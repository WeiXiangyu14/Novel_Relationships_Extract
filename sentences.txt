    HARRY_POTTER and the sorcerer's stone.
chapter one.
the boy who lived.
mr. and MRS._DURSLEY, of number four, privet drive, were proud to say that mr. and MRS._DURSLEY, of number four, privet drive were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
mr. and MRS._DURSLEY, of number four, privet drive were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because mr. and MRS._DURSLEY, of number four, privet drive just didn't hold with such nonsense.
MR._DURSLEY was the director of a firm called grunnings, which made drills.
MR._DURSLEY was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although MR._DURSLEY did have a very large mustache.
MR._DURSLEY was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as MR._DURSLEY spent so much of MR._DURSLEY time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.
the DURSLEYS had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
the DURSLEYS had everything their wanTED, but their also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
their didn't think their could bear it if anyone found out about the POTTERs.
MR._DURSLEY was MRS._DURSLEY's sister, but their hadn't met for several years; in fact, MR._DURSLEY pretended MR._DURSLEY didn't have a sister, because MR._DURSLEY sister and MR._DURSLEY good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be.
the DURSLEYS shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the POTTERs arrived in the street.
the DURSLEYS knew that the POTTERs had a small son, too, but the POTTERs had a small son, too,  had never even seen a small son.
a small son was another good reason for keeping the POTTERs away; the POTTERs had a small son, too,  didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that.
when MR._DURSLEY woke up on the dull, gray tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.
MR._DURSLEY hummed as MR._DURSLEY picked out MR._DURSLEY most boring tie for work, and MR._DURSLEY gossiped away happily as MR._DURSLEY wrestled a screaming dudley into MR._DURSLEY high chair.
none of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
at half past eight, MR._DURSLEY picked up MR._DURSLEY briefcase, pecked MR._DURSLEY on the cheek, and tried to kiss dudley good-bye but missed, because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing dudley cereal at the walls.
"little tyke," chortled MR._DURSLEY as MR._DURSLEY left the house.
MR._DURSLEY got into MR._DURSLEY car and backed out of number four's drive.
it was on the corner of the street that MR._DURSLEY noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map.
for a second, MR._DURSLEY didn't realize what MR._DURSLEY had seen -- then MR._DURSLEY jerked MR._DURSLEY head around to look again.
there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive, but there wasn't a map in sight.
what could MR._DURSLEY have been thinking of?
it must have been a trick of the light.
MR._DURSLEY blinked and stared at a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive.
MR._DURSLEY stared back.
as MR._DURSLEY drove around the corner and up the road, MR._DURSLEY watched a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive in MR._DURSLEY mirror.
it was now reading the sign that said privet drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs.
MR._DURSLEY gave MR._DURSLEY a little shake and put a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive out of MR._DURSLEY mind.
as MR._DURSLEY drove toward town MR._DURSLEY thought of nothing except a large order of drills MR._DURSLEY was hoping to get that day.
but on the edge of town, drills were driven out of MR._DURSLEY mind by something else.
as MR._DURSLEY sat in the usual morning traffic jam, MR._DURSLEY couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.
people in clOAKs.
MR._DURSLEY couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!
MR._DURSLEY supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
MR._DURSLEY drummed MR._DURSLEY fingers on the steering wheel and MR._DURSLEY eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
they were whispering exciTEDly together.
MR._DURSLEY was enraged to see that a couple of they weren't young at all; why, MR._DURSLEY had to be older than MR._DURSLEY was, and wearing an emerald-green clOAK!
the nerve of MR._DURSLEY!
but then the nerve of him struck MR._DURSLEY that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it.
the traffic moved on and a few minutes later, MR._DURSLEYarrived in the grunnings parking lot, MR._DURSLEY mind back on drills.
MR._DURSLEY always sat with MR._DURSLEY back to the window in MR._DURSLEY office on the ninth floor.
if MR._DURSLEY hadn't, MR._DURSLEY might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.
MR._DURSLEY didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; people poinTED and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.
most of people had never seen an owl even at nighttime.
MR._DURSLEY, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
MR._DURSLEY yelled at five different people.
MR._DURSLEY made several important telephone calls and shouTED a bit more.
MR._DURSLEY was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when MR._DURSLEY thought MR._DURSLEY'd stretch MR._DURSLEY legs and walk across the road to buy MR._DURSLEY a bun from the bakery.
MR._DURSLEY'd forgotten all about the people in clOAKs until MR._DURSLEY passed a group of the people in clOAKs next to the baker's.
MR._DURSLEY eyed the people in clOAKs angrily as MR._DURSLEY passed.
MR._DURSLEY didn't know why, but the people in clOAKs made MR._DURSLEY uneasy.
this bunch were whispering exciTEDly, too, and MR._DURSLEY couldn't see a single collecting tin.
it was on MR._DURSLEY way back past the people in clOAKs, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that MR._DURSLEY caught a few words of what the people in clOAKs were saying.
"the POTTERs, that's right, that's what i heard yes, the POTTERs son, HARRY_POTTER"
    MR._DURSLEY stopped dead.
fear flooded "
    MR._DURSLEY. "
MR._DURSLEY looked back at the whisperers as if "
    MR._DURSLEY wanTED to say something to them, but thought better of the whisperers.
    "
MR._DURSLEY dashed back across the road, hurried up to "
    MR._DURSLEY office, snapped at "
    MR._DURSLEY secretary not to disturb "
    MR._DURSLEY, seized "
    MR._DURSLEY telephone, and had almost finished dialing "
    MR._DURSLEY home number when "
    MR._DURSLEY changed "
    MR._DURSLEY mind. "
MR._DURSLEY put the receiver back down and stroked "
    MR._DURSLEY mustache, thinking... no, "
    MR._DURSLEY was being stupid.
POTTER wasn't such an unusual name.
POTTER was sure there were lots of people called POTTER who had a son called HARRY_POTTER.
come to think of it, POTTER wasn't even sure POTTER nephew was called HARRY_POTTER.
POTTER'd never even seen his nephew .
it might have been HARVEY.
or HAROLD.
there was no point in worrying MRS._DURSLEY; MRS._DURSLEY always got so upset at any mention of MRS._DURSLEY sister.
POTTER didn't blame MRS._DURSLEY -- if POTTER'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in clOAKs...
    POTTER found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when POTTER left the building at five o'clock, POTTER was still so worried that POTTER walked straight into someone just outside the door.
"sorry," POTTER grunTED, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
it was a few seconds before MRS._DURSLEY realized that the man was wearing a violet clOAK.
the man  didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.
on the contrary, the man  face split into a wide smile and the man  said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "DON't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
rejoice, for YOU-KNOW-who has gone at last!
even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"
and the man  hugged MRS._DURSLEY around the middle and walked off.
MR._DURSLEY stood rooTED to the spot.
MR._DURSLEY had been hugged by a complete stranger.
MR._DURSLEY also thought MR._DURSLEY had been called a muggle, whatever that was.
MR._DURSLEY was rattled.
MR._DURSLEY hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping MR._DURSLEY was imagining things, which MR._DURSLEY had never hoped before, because MR._DURSLEY didn't approve of imagination.
as MR._DURSLEY pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing MR._DURSLEY saw -- and it didn't improve MR._DURSLEY mood -- was the tabby cat MR._DURSLEY'd spotTED that morning.
the tabby cat he'd spotTED that morning was now sitting on MR._DURSLEY garden wall.
MR._DURSLEY was sure the tabby cat he'd spotTED that morning was the same one; the tabby cat he'd spotTED that morning had the same markings around the tabby cat he'd spotTED that morning eyes.
"shoo!"
said MR._DURSLEY loudly.
the tabby cat he'd spotTED that morning didn't move.
the tabby cat he'd spotTED that morning just gave MR._DURSLEY a stern look.
was this normal cat behavior?
MR._DURSLEYwondered.
trying to pull MR._DURSLEY together, MR._DURSLEY let MR._DURSLEY into the house.
MR._DURSLEY was still determined not to mention anything to MR._DURSLEY wife.
MR._DURSLEY had had a nice, normal day.
MR._DURSLEY told MR._DURSLEY over dinner all about mrs. NEXT_DOOR's problems with MR._DURSLEY daughter and how dudley had learned a new word ("won't!").
MR._DURSLEY tried to act normally.
when dudley had been put to bed, dudley went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
    "and finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reporTED that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.
although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.
experts are unable to explain why the nation's owlshave suddenly changed experts sLEE_JORDANping pattern."
the newscaster allowed the newscaster a grin.
"most mysterious.
and now, over to JIM_MCGUFFIN with the weather.
going to be any more showers of owls tonight, JIM_MCGUFFIN?"
"well, TED," said the weatherman, "i DON't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.
viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday, viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, and dundee have been phoning in to 've had a downpour of shooting stars!
perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early -- it's not until next week, folks!
but i can promise a wet night tonight."
MR._DURSLEY sat frozen in MR._DURSLEY armchair.
shooting stars all over britain?
owls flying by daylight?
mysterious people in clOAKs all over the place?
and a whisper, a whisper about the POTTERs...
    MR._DURSLEY came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.
it was no good.
MR._DURSLEY'd have to say something to MR._DURSLEY.
MR._DURSLEY cleared MR._DURSLEY throat nervously.
"er -- PETUNIA, dear -- you haven't heard from her sister lately, have you?"
as MR._DURSLEY had expecTED, MR._DURSLEY looked shocked and angry.
after all, they normally pretended MR._DURSLEY didn't have a sister.
"no," MR._DURSLEY said sharply.
"why?"
"funny stuff on the news,mr.
dursley mumbled.
"owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
    "so?"
snapped MR._DURSLEY.
"well, i just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... MR._DURSLEY crowd."
MR._DURSLEY sipped MR._DURSLEY tea through pursed lips.
MR._DURSLEYwondered whether MR._DURSLEY dared tell MR._DURSLEY MR._DURSLEY'd heard the name "POTTER."
MR._DURSLEY decided MR._DURSLEY didn't dare.
instead MR._DURSLEY said, as casually as MR._DURSLEY could, "their son -- MR._DURSLEY'd be about dudley's age now, wouldn't mr.
dursley?"
"i suppose so," said MR._DURSLEY stiffly.
"what's MR._DURSLEY name again?
MR._DURSLEY, isn't it?"
HARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER.
nasty, common name, if you ask me."
"oh, yes," said MR._DURSLEY, his heart sinking horribly.
"yes, i quite agree."
his didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
while MR._DURSLEY was in the bathroom, MR._DURSLEY crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
the cat was still there.
the cat was staring down privet drive as though the cat were waiting for something.
was his imagining things?
could all this have anything to do with the POTTERs?
if it did... if it did got out that they were relaTED to a pair of -- well, his didn't think his could bear it did.
the DURSLEYS got into bed.
MR._DURSLEY fell asLEE_JORDANp quickly but MR._DURSLEY lay awake, turning it all over in MR._DURSLEY mind.
MR._DURSLEY last, comforting thought before MR._DURSLEY fell asLEE_JORDANp was that even if the POTTERs were involved, there was no reason for the POTTERs to come near MR._DURSLEY and MR._DURSLEY.
the POTTERs knew very well what MR._DURSLEY and PETUNIA thought about the POTTERs and the POTTERs kind.... MR._DURSLEY couldn't see how MR._DURSLEY and PETUNIA could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- MR._DURSLEY yawned and turned over -- PETUNIA couldn't affect he and PETUNIA....
    how very wrong MR._DURSLEY was.
MR._DURSLEY might have been drifting into an uneasy sLEE_JORDANp, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sLEE_JORDANpiness.
it was sitting as still as a statue, it eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive.
it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.
in fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought a man'd just popped out of the ground.
the cat's tail twitched and the cat eyes narrowed.
nothing like a man had ever been seen on privet drive.
a man was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of a man hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into a man belt.
a man was wearing long robes, a purple clOAK that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
a man blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and a man nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.
this man's name was ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE didn't seem to realize that ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE had just arrived in a street where everything from ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE name to ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE boots was unwelcome.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was busy rummaging in ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE clOAK, looking for something.
but ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE did seem to realize ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was being watched, because ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE from the other end of the street.
for some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE chuckled and muttered, "i should have known."
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE found what ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was looking for in ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE inside pocket.
it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.
the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE clicked the nearest street lamp again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness.
twelve times ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE clicked the put-outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
if anyone looked out of anyone  window now, even beady-eyed MRS._DURSLEY, anyone  wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE slipped the put-outer back inside his clOAK and set off down the street toward number four, where ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE sat down on his garden wall next to the cat.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE didn't look at the cat, but after a MOMent ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE spoke to the cat.
"fancy seeing you here, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL."
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE turned to smile at the tabby, but the tabby had gone.
instead ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around the cat eyes.
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes, too, was wearing a clOAK, an emerald one.
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes black hair was drawn into a tight bun.
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes looked distinctly ruffled.
"how did you know it was me?"
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes asked.
"my dear professor, i 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
"you'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"all day?
when you could have been celebrating?
i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here."
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL sniffed angrily.
"oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes said impatiently.
"you'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the muggles have noticed something's going on.
it was on they news."
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes jerked a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes head back at the DURSLEYS' dark living-room window.
"i heard the DURSLEYS' dark living-room window.
flocks of owls... shooting stars.... well, flocks of owls... shooting stars....'re not completely stupid.
flocks of owls... shooting stars.... were bound to notice something.
shooting stars down in kent -- i'll bet that was DEDALUS_DIGGLE.
he never had much sense."
"you can't blame flocks of owls... shooting stars....," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE gently.
"we've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years."
"i know that," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL irritably.
"but that's no reason to lose we heads.
people are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, swapping rumors."
a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes threw a sharp, sideways glance at ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE here, as though hoping ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was going to tell a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes something, but ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE didn't, so a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes went on.
"a fine thing it would be if, on the very day youKNOW-WHO seems to have disappeared at last, even the muggles found out about us all.
i suppose ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE really has gone, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE?"
"it certainly seems so," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"us have much to be thankful for.
would you care for a lemon drop?"
"a what?"
"a lemon drop.
they're a kind of muggle sweet i'm rather fond of"
    "no, thank you," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL coldly, as though professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL didn't think this was the MOMent for lemon drops.
"as i say, even if YOU-KNOW-who has gone -"
    "my dear professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself name?
all this 'you- KNOW-WHO' nonsense -- for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call a sensible person like yourself by a sensible person like yourself proper name: VOLDEMORT."
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL flinched, but ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
"it all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'YOU-KNOW-who.'
i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying VOLDEMORT's name.
"i know you haven 't, said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, sounding half exasperaTED, half admiring.
"but you're different.
everyone knows you're the only one YOU-KNOW- oh, all right, VOLDEMORT, was frightened of."
"you flatter me," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE calmly.
"VOLDEMORT had powers i will never have."
"only because you're too -- well -- noble to use VOLDEMORT."
"it's lucky it's dark.
i haven't blushed so much since MADAM_POMFTEY told me madam  liked my new earmuffs.professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL shot a sharp look at ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE and said, "the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
you know what everyone's saying?
about why he's disappeared?
about what finally stopped he?"
it seemed that professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had reached the point professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was most anxious to discuss, the real reason professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had a woman fixed ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE with such a piercing stare as professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL did now.
it was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was not going to believe it until ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE told professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL it was true.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
"what they're saying," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL pressed on, "is that last night VOLDEMORT turned up in GODRIC's hollow.
VOLDEMORT went to find the POTTERs.
the rumor is that LILY and JAMES_POTTER are -- are -- that LILY and JAMES_POTTER're -- dead.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE bowed ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE head.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL gasped.
"LILY and JAMES_POTTER...
i can't believe it...
i didn't want to believe it... oh, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE...ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE reached out and patTED ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE on the shoulder.
"i know...
i know..." professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL said heavily.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's voice trembled as professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL went on.
"that's not all.
they're saying professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL tried to kill the POTTER's son, HARRY_POTTER.
but -- professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL couldn't.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL couldn't kill that little boy.
no one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL couldn't kill HARRY_POTTER, VOLDEMORT's power somehow broke -- and that's why professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's gone.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE nodded glumly.
"it's -- it's true?"
faltered professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"after all professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's DONe... all the people professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's killed...
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL couldn't kill a little boy?
it's just astounding... of all the things to stop professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL... but how in the name of heaven did HARRY_POTTER survive?"
"we can only guess," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"we may never know."
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL eyes beneath professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL spectacles.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE gave a great sniff as ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE took a golden watch from ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE pocket and examined a golden watch.
it was a very odd watch.
it had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.
it must have made sense toALBUS_DUMBLEDOREALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, though, because ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE put it back in his pocket and said, "hagrid's late.
i suppose it was ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE who told you i'd be here, by the way?"
"yes," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"and i DON't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?"
"i've come to bring HARRY_POTTER to HARRY_POTTER aunt and uncle.
his aunt and uncle're the only family HARRY_POTTER has left now."
"you DON't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?"
cried professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, jumping to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL feet and pointing at number four.
"dumbledore -- you can't.
i've been watching his aunt and uncle all day.
you couldn't find two people who are less like us.
and two people who are less like us've got this son -- i saw this son kicking this son MOTHER all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
HARRY_POTTER come and live here!"
"it's the best place for this son," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE firmly.
"ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE when ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's older.
i've written his aunt and uncle a letter."
"a letter?"
repeaTED professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL faintly, sitting back down on his garden wall.
"really, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
these people will never understand ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE!
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE'll be famous -- a legend -- i wouldn't be surprised if today was known as HARRY_POTTER day in the future -- there will be books written about HARRY_POTTER -- every child in our world will know HARRY_POTTER name!"
"exactly," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, looking very seriously over the top of ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE half-moon glasses.
"it would be enough to turn any boy's head.
famous before ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE can walk and talk!
famous for something ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE won't even remember!
cara you see how much better off ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE'll be, growing up away from all that until ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's ready to take it?professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL opened professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL mouth, changed professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL mind, swallowed, and then said, "yes -- yes, you're right, of course.
but how is ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE getting here, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE?"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL eyed his clOAK suddenly as though professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL thought ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE might be hiding HARRY_POTTER underneath his clOAK.
"hagrid's bringing HARRY_POTTER."
"you think it -- wise -- to trust hagrid with something as important as this?"
i would trust hagrid with my life," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"i'm not saying ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE heart isn't in the right place," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL grudgingly, "but you can't pretend ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's not careless.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE does tend to -- what was that?"
a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. "
a low rumbling sound grew steadily louder as them looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; "
    a low rumbling sound swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of they.
if a huge motorcycle was huge, a huge motorcycle was nothing to the man sitting astride a huge motorcycle.
the man sitting astride it was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.
the man sitting astride it looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of the man sitting astride it face, the man sitting astride it had hands the size of trash can lids, and the man sitting astride it feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.
in the man sitting astride it vast, muscular arms the man sitting astride it was holding a bundle of blankets.
"hagrid," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, sounding relieved.
"at last.
and where did you get a huge motorcycle?"
"borrowed it, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off a huge motorcycle as ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE spoke.
"young sirius black lent it to sir.
i've got young sirius black, sir."
"no problems, were there?"
"no, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but i got sir out all right before even the muggles starTED swarmin' around.
sir fell asLEE_JORDANp as we was flyin' over bristol.ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE and professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL bent forward over a bundle of blankets.
inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asLEE_JORDANp.
under a tuft of jet-black hair over sir forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
"is that where -?"
whispered professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"yes," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE'll have that scar forever."
"couldn't you do something about it, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE?"
"even if i could, i wouldn't.
scars can come in handy.
i have one sir above my left knee that is a perfect map of the lonDON underground.
well -- give ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE here, hagrid -- we'd better get this over with.ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE took HARRY_POTTER in ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE arms and turned toward the DURSLEYS' house.
"could i -- could i say good-bye to him, sir?"
asked hagrid.
sir bent sir great, shaggy head over HARRY_POTTER and gave sir what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.
then, suddenly, hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
"shhh!"
hissed professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, "you'll wake even the muggles!"
"s-s-sorry," sobbed hagrid, taking out a large, spotTED handkerchief and burying hagrid face in it.
"but i c-c-can't stand it -- LILY and JAMES_POTTER an' JAMES_POTTER dead -- an' poor little HARRY_POTTER off ter live with muggles -"
    "yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, hagrid, or we'll be found," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL whispered, patting hagridgingerly on the arm as ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE laid HARRY_POTTER gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his clOAK, tucked a letter inside HARRY_POTTER's blankets, and then came back to the other two.
for a full minute the three of the other two stood and looked at the little bundle; hagrid's shoulders shook, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's eyes seemed to have gone out.
"well," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE finally, "that's that.
we've no business staying here.
we may as well go and join the celebrations."
"yeah," said hagrid in a very muffled voice, "i'll be takin' sirius hagrid bike back.
g'night, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL -- professor dumbledore, sir."
wiping hagrid streaming eyes on hagrid jacket sLEE_JORDANve, hagrid swung hagrid onto a huge motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar the engine rose into the air and off into the night.
"i shall see you soon, i expect, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, nodding to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL blew professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL nose in reply.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE turned and walked back down the street.
on the corner ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE stopped and took out the silver put-outer.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE clicked the silver put-outer once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner  at the other end of the street.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
"good luck, HARRY_POTTER," HARRY_POTTER murmured.
HARRY_POTTER turned on HARRY_POTTER heel and with a swish of HARRY_POTTER , HARRY_POTTER was gone.
a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
HARRY_POTTER rolled over inside HARRY_POTTER blankets without waking up.
one small hand closed on the letter beside HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER slept on, not knowing HARRY_POTTER was special, not knowing HARRY_POTTER was famous, not knowing HARRY_POTTER would be woken in a few hours' time by MRS._DURSLEY's scream as MRS._DURSLEY opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that HARRY_POTTER would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by HARRY_POTTER cousin dudley... HARRY_POTTER couldn't know that at this very MOMent, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up people glasses and saying in hushed voices: "to HARRY_POTTER -- the boy who lived!"
chapter two.
the vanishing glass.
nearly ten years had passed since the DURSLEYS had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all.
the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the DURSLEYS front door; the sun crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as the sun had been on the night when MRS._DURSLEY had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but MRS._DURSLEY was no longer a baby, and now only the photographs on the mantelpiece showed a large blond boy riding a large blond boy first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with a large blond boy father, being hugged and kissed by a large blond boy .
the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
yet HARRY_POTTER was still there, asLEE_JORDANp at the MOMent, but not for long.
HARRY_POTTER AUNT_PETUNIA was awake and his AUNT_PETUNIA was his AUNT_PETUNIA shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
"up!
get up!
now!"
HARRY_POTTER woke with a start.
his AUNT_PETUNIA rapped on the door again.
"up!"
his AUNT_PETUNIA screeched.
HARRY_POTTER heard his AUNT_PETUNIA walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.
HARRY_POTTER rolled onto HARRY_POTTER back and tried to remember the dream HARRY_POTTER had been having.
it had been a good one.
there had been a flying motorcycle in it.
HARRY_POTTER had a funny feeling HARRY_POTTER'd had the same dream before.
his AUNT_PETUNIA was back outside the door.
"are you up yet?"
his AUNT_PETUNIA demanded.
"nearly," said HARRY_POTTER.
"well, get a move on, i want you to look after the bacon.
and DON't you dare let the bacon burn, i want everything perfect on DUDDY's birthday."
HARRY_POTTER groaned.
"what did you say?"
"
    HARRY_POTTER snapped through the door.
"nothing, nothing..."
    dudley's birthday -- how could dudley have forgotten?
HARRY_POTTER got slowly out of bed and starTED looking for socks.
HARRY_POTTER found a pair under HARRY_POTTER bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put themon.
HARRY_POTTER was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of spiders, and that was where HARRY_POTTER slept.
when HARRY_POTTER was dressed HARRY_POTTER went down the hall into the kitchen .
the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley's birthday presents.
the table looked as though MRS._DURSLEY had gotten the new computer MRS._DURSLEY wanTED, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.
exactly why MRS._DURSLEY wanTED a racing bike was a mystery to HARRY_POTTER, as MRS._DURSLEYwas very fat and haTED exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody.
MRS._DURSLEY's favorite punching bag was HARRY_POTTER, but MRS._DURSLEY couldn't often catch MRS._DURSLEY.
HARRY_POTTER didn't look it, but HARRY_POTTER was very fast.
perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but HARRY_POTTER had always been small and skinny for HARRY_POTTER age.
HARRY_POTTER looked even smaller and skinnier than HARRY_POTTER really was because all HARRY_POTTER had to wear were old clothes of MRS._DURSLEY's, and MRS._DURSLEY was about four times bigger than HARRY_POTTER was.
HARRY_POTTER had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.
HARRY_POTTER wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times MRS._DURSLEY had punched HARRY_POTTER on the nose.
the only thing HARRY_POTTER liked about HARRY_POTTER own appearance was a very thin scar on HARRY_POTTER forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
HARRY_POTTER had had it as long as HARRY_POTTER could remember, and the first question HARRY_POTTER could ever remember asking his AUNT_PETUNIA his AUNT_PETUNIA was how HARRY_POTTER had gotten it.
"in the car crash when your parents died," his AUNT_PETUNIA had said.
"and DON't ask questions."
DON't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the DURSLEYS.
UNCLE_VERNON entered the kitchen  as HARRY_POTTER was turning over the bacon.
"comb your hair!"
he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
about once a week, UNCLE_VERNON looked over the top of UNCLE_VERNON newspaper and shouTED that HARRY_POTTER needed a haircut.
HARRY_POTTER must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in HARRY_POTTER class put
    together, but it made no difference, HARRY_POTTER hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.
HARRY_POTTER was frying eggs by the time MRS._DURSLEY arrived in the kitchen with MRS._DURSLEY .
MRS._DURSLEY looked a lot like UNCLE_VERNON.
MRS._DURSLEY had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on MRS._DURSLEY thick, fat head.
his AUNT_PETUNIAoften said that MRS._DURSLEY looked like a baby angel -- HARRY_POTTER often said that MRS._DURSLEY looked like a pig in a wig.
HARRY_POTTER put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room.
MRS._DURSLEY, meanwhile, was counting MRS._DURSLEY presents.
a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head fell.
"thirty-six," MRS._DURSLEY said, looking up at MRS._DURSLEY MOTHER and father.
"that's two less than last year."
"darling, you haven't counTED AUNTIE_MARGE's present, see, it's here under this big one from MOMmy and daddy."
"all right, thirty-seven then," said MRS._DURSLEY, going red in a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.
HARRY_POTTER, who could see a huge MRS._DURSLEY tantrum coming on, began wolfing down MRS._DURSLEY bacon as fast as possible in case MRS._DURSLEY turned the table over.
his AUNT_PETUNIA obviously scenTED danger, too, because his AUNT_PETUNIA said quickly, "and we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today.
how's that, popkin?
two more presents.
is that all right''
    MRS._DURSLEY thought for a MOMent.
it looked like hard work.
finally MRS._DURSLEY said slowly, "so i'll have thirty ... thirty..."
    "thirty-nine, sweetums," said his AUNT_PETUNIA.
"oh."
MRS._DURSLEY sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel.
"all right then."
UNCLE_VERNON chuckled.
"little tyke wants little tyke money's worth, just like little tyke .
'atta boy, mrs.
dursley!"
atta boy, dudley!"
ruffled MRS._DURSLEY's hair.
at that MOMent the telephone rang and his AUNT_PETUNIA went to answer the telephone rang and AUNT_PETUNIA while HARRY_POTTER and UNCLE_VERNON watched MRS._DURSLEY unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a vcr.
atta boy, dudley!"
was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when his AUNT_PETUNIA came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
"bad news, UNCLE_VERNON," his AUNT_PETUNIA said.
"mrs. FIGG's broken mrs. FIGG leg.
mrs. FIGG can't take atta boy, dudley!"."
mrs. FIGG jerked mrs. FIGG head in HARRY_POTTER's direction.
MRS._DURSLEY's mouth fell open in horror, but HARRY_POTTER's heart gave a leap.
every year on MRS._DURSLEY's birthday, MRS._DURSLEY parents took MRS._DURSLEY and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.
every year, HARRY_POTTER was left behind with mrs. FIGG, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.
HARRY_POTTER haTED it there.
the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs. FIGG made mrs. FIGG look at photographs of all the cats mrs. FIGG'd ever owned.
"now what?"
said his AUNT_PETUNIA, looking furiously at HARRY_POTTER as though mrs. FIGG'd planned this.
HARRY_POTTER knew HARRY_POTTER ought to feel sorry that mrs. FIGG had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when HARRY_POTTER reminded HARRY_POTTER it would be a whole year before HARRY_POTTER had to look at TIBBLES, snowy, mr. PAWS, and TUFTY again.
"we could phone MARGE," UNCLE_VERNON suggesTED.
"DON't be silly, UNCLE_VERNON, UNCLE_VERNON hates a large blond boy."
the DURSLEYS often spoke about HARRY_POTTER like this, as though HARRY_POTTER wasn't there -- or rather, as though HARRY_POTTER was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.
"what about what's-her-name, your friend -- YVONNE?"
"on vacation in majorca," snapped his AUNT_PETUNIA.
"you could just leave me here,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER put in hopefully (HARRY_POTTER'd be able to watch what HARRY_POTTER wanTED on television for a change and maybe even have a go on MRS._DURSLEY's computer).
his AUNT_PETUNIA looked as though his AUNT_PETUNIA'd just swallowed a lemon.
"and come back and find the whole house smelled of cabbage in ruins?"
his AUNT_PETUNIA snarled.
"i won't blow up the whole house smelled of cabbage," said HARRY_POTTER, but the whole house smelled of cabbage weren't listening.
"i suppose we could take HARRY_POTTER to the zoo," said his AUNT_PETUNIA slowly, "... and leave HARRY_POTTER in the car...."
    "the car's new, HARRY_POTTER's not sitting in the car alone...."
    MRS._DURSLEY began to cry loudly.
in fact, HARRY_POTTER wasn't really crying -- it had been years since HARRY_POTTER'd really cried -- but HARRY_POTTER knew that if HARRY_POTTER screwed up HARRY_POTTER face and wailed, his MOTHER would give HARRY_POTTER anything HARRY_POTTER wanTED.
"DINKY_DUDDYDUMS, DON't cry, MUMMY won't let HARRY_POTTER spoil your special day!"
his MOTHER cried, flinging his MOTHER arms around HARRY_POTTER.
"i... DON't... want... HARRY_POTTER... t-t-to come!"
MRS._DURSLEY yelled between huge, pretend sobs.
"MRS._DURSLEY always sp- spoils everything!"
MRS._DURSLEY shot HARRY_POTTER a nasty grin through the gap in MRS._DURSLEY 's arms.
just then, the doorCHASER_KATIE_BELL rang -- "oh, good lord, the doorCHASER_KATIE_BELL rang --'re here!"
said his AUNT_PETUNIA frantically -- and a MOMent later, MRS._DURSLEY's best friend, PIERS_POLKISS, walked in with dudley's  .
PIERS_POLKISS was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat.
a scrawny boy was usually the one who held people's arms behind people backs while MRS._DURSLEY hit people.
MRS._DURSLEYstopped pretending to cry at once.
half an hour later, HARRY_POTTER, who couldn't believe MRS._DURSLEY luck, was sitting in the back of the DURSLEYS car with PIERS_POLKISS and MRS._DURSLEY, on the way to the zoo for the first time in MRS._DURSLEY life.
MRS._DURSLEY aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with MRS._DURSLEY, but before his aunt and uncle'd left, UNCLE_VERNON had taken HARRY_POTTER aside.
"i'm warning you," UNCLE_VERNON had said, putting UNCLE_VERNON large purple face right up close to HARRY_POTTER's, "i'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until christmas."
"i'm not going to do anything," said HARRY_POTTER, "honestly..
but UNCLE_VERNON didn't believe HARRY_POTTER.
no one ever did.
the problem was, strange things often happened around HARRY_POTTER and it was just no good telling the DURSLEYS HARRY_POTTER didn't make the DURSLEYS happen.
once, his AUNT_PETUNIA, tired of HARRY_POTTER coming back from the barbers looking as though HARRY_POTTER hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut HARRY_POTTER hair so short HARRY_POTTER was almost bald except for HARRY_POTTER bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar."
MRS._DURSLEY had laughed MRS._DURSLEY silly at HARRY_POTTER, who spent a sLEE_JORDANpless night imagining school the next day, where MRS._DURSLEY was already laughed at for MRS._DURSLEY baggy clothes and taped glasses.
next morning, however, MRS._DURSLEY had gotten up to find his hair exactly as his hair had been before his AUNT_PETUNIA had sheared his hair off MRS._DURSLEY had been given a week in MRS._DURSLEY cupboard for this, even though MRS._DURSLEY had tried to explain that MRS._DURSLEY couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
another time, his AUNT_PETUNIA had been trying to force MRS._DURSLEY into a revolting old sweater of MRS._DURSLEY's (BROWN with orange puff balls) -- the harder his AUNT_PETUNIA tried to pull the over MRS._DURSLEY head, the smaller the seemed to become, until finally the might have fitTED a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit HARRY_POTTER.
his AUNT_PETUNIA had decided the must have shrunk in the wash and, to his AUNT_PETUNIA great relief, HARRY_POTTER wasn't punished.
on the other hand, HARRY_POTTER'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.
MRS._DURSLEY's gang had been CHASINg HARRY_POTTER as usual when, as much to HARRY_POTTER's surprise as anyone else's, there HARRY_POTTER was sitting on the chimney.
the DURSLEYS had received a very angry letter from HARRY_POTTER's headmistress telling them HARRY_POTTER had been climbing school buildings.
but all HARRY_POTTER'd tried to do (as HARRY_POTTER shouTED at UNCLE_VERNON through the locked door of UNCLE_VERNON cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.
HARRY_POTTER supposed that the wind must have caught HARRY_POTTER in mid- jump.
but today, nothing was going to go wrong.
it was even worth being with MRS._DURSLEY and PIERS_POLKISS to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, UNCLE_VERNON cupboard, or mrs. FIGG's cabbage-smelling living room.
while UNCLE_VERNON drove, UNCLE_VERNON complained to his AUNT_PETUNIA.
UNCLE_VERNON liked to complain about things: people at work, HARRY_POTTER, the council, HARRY_POTTER, the bank, and HARRY_POTTER were just a few of UNCLE_VERNON favorite subjects.
this morning, it was motorcycles.
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," UNCLE_VERNON said, as a motorcycle overtook them.
i had a dream about a motorcycle," said HARRY_POTTER, remembering suddenly.
"it was flying.UNCLE_VERNON UNCLE_VERNON nearly crashed into the car in front.
UNCLE_VERNON turned right around in UNCLE_VERNON seat and yelled at HARRY_POTTER, UNCLE_VERNON face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "motorcycles DON't fly!"
dudley and PIERS_POLKISS sniggered.
i know "
    dudley and PIERS_POLKISS DON't," said HARRY_POTTER.
"it was only a dream."
but HARRY_POTTER wished HARRY_POTTER hadn't said anything.
if there was one thing the DURSLEYS haTED even more than HARRY_POTTER asking questions, the DURSLEYS was HARRY_POTTER talking about anything acting in a way the DURSLEYS shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think HARRY_POTTER might get dangerous ideas.
it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.
the DURSLEYS bought dudley and PIERS_POLKISS large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked HARRY_POTTER what HARRY_POTTER wanTED before they could hurry HARRY_POTTER away, they bought HARRY_POTTER a cheap lemon ice pop.
it wasn't bad, either, HARRY_POTTER thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching it head who looked remarkably like MRS._DURSLEY, except that it wasn't blond.
HARRY_POTTER had the best morning HARRY_POTTER'd had in a long time.
HARRY_POTTER was careful to walk a little way apart from the DURSLEYS so that MRS._DURSLEY and PIERS_POLKISS, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on the animals  favorite hobby of hitting HARRY_POTTER.
the animals  ate in the zoo restaurant, and when MRS._DURSLEY had a tantrum because MRS._DURSLEY kNICKerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, UNCLE_VERNON bought MRS._DURSLEY another one and HARRY_POTTER was allowed to finish the first.
HARRY_POTTER felt, afterward, that HARRY_POTTER should have known it was all too good to last.
after lunch the animals  went to the reptile house.
the reptile house was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.
behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of WOOD and stone.
dudley and PIERS_POLKISS wanTED to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.
MRS._DURSLEY quickly found the largest snake in the place.
the largest snake in the place could have wrapped the largest snake in the place body twice around UNCLE_VERNON car and crushed its body into a trash can -- but at the MOMent its body didn't look in the mood.
in fact, it was fast asLEE_JORDANp.
MRS._DURSLEY stood with MRS._DURSLEY nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening BROWN coils.
"make it move," MRS._DURSLEY whined at MRS._DURSLEY father.
UNCLE_VERNON tapped on the glass, but the largest snake in the place didn't budge.
"do the largest snake in the place again," MRS._DURSLEY ordered.
UNCLE_VERNON rapped the glasssmartly with UNCLE_VERNON knuckles, but the largest snake in the place just snoozed on.
"this is boring," MRS._DURSLEY moaned.
MRS._DURSLEY shuffled away.
HARRY_POTTER moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the largest snake in the place.
HARRY_POTTER wouldn't have been surprised if the largest snake in the place had died of boredom the largest snake in the place -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.
it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was AUNT_PETUNIA hammering on the door to wake you up; at least HARRY_POTTER got to visit the rest of the reptile house.
the largest snake in the place suddenly opened the largest snake in the place beady eyes.
slowly, very slowly, the largest snake in the place raised the largest snake in the place head until its beady eyes were on a level with HARRY_POTTER's.
the largest snake in the place winked.
HARRY_POTTER stared.
then HARRY_POTTER looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.
anyone was watching weren't.
HARRY_POTTER looked back at the largest snake in the place and winked, too.
the largest snake in the place jerked its head toward UNCLE_VERNON and dudley, then raised its beady eyes to the ceiling.
the largest snake in the place gave HARRY_POTTER a look that said quite plainly:
    "i get that all the time.
"i know,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER murmured through the glass, though HARRY_POTTER wasn't sure the largest snake in the place could hear HARRY_POTTER.
"it must be really annoying."
the largest snake in the place nodded vigorously.
"where do you come from, anyway?"
HARRY_POTTER asked.
the largest snake in the place jabbed the largest snake in the place tail at a little sign next to the glass.
HARRY_POTTER peered at the glass.
BOA_CONSTRICTOR, brazil.
"was it nice there?"
the BOA_CONSTRICTOR jabbed "
    the BOA_CONSTRICTOR at a little sign again and HARRY_POTTER read on: this specimen was bred in the zoo.
"oh, i see -- so you've never been to brazil?"
as the largest snake in the place shook the largest snake in the place head, a deafening shout behind HARRY_POTTERmade both of a deafening shout behind HARRY_POTTER  jump.
"dudley!
MR._DURSLEY!
come and look at the largest snake in the place!
you won't believe what it's doing!
"dudley came waddling toward them as fast as "dudley could.
"out of the way, you," "dudley said, punching HARRY_POTTER in the ribs.
caught by surprise, HARRY_POTTER fell hard on the concrete floor.
what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, PIERS_POLKISS and MRS._DURSLEY were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.
HARRY_POTTER sat up and gasped; the glass front of the BOA_CONSTRICTOR's tank had vanished.
the largest snake in the place was uncoiling the largest snake in the place rapidly, slithering out onto the concrete floor.
people throughout the reptile housescreamed and starTED running for the exits.
as the largest snake in the place slid swiftly past him, HARRY_POTTER could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "brazil, here i come.... thanksss, amigo."
the keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
"but the glass," him kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
the zoo director himself made his AUNT_PETUNIA a cup of strong, sweet tea while "
    the zoo director himself apologized over and over again.
PIERS_POLKISS and MRS._DURSLEY could only gibber.
as far as HARRY_POTTER had seen, the largest snake in the placehadn't DONe anything except snap playfully at PIERS_POLKISS and dudley heels as the largest snake in the place passed, but by the time PIERS_POLKISS and dudley were all back in UNCLE_VERNON car, MRS._DURSLEY was telling PIERS_POLKISS and dudley how the largest snake in the place had nearly bitten off MRS._DURSLEY leg, while PIERS_POLKISS was swearing the largest snake in the place had tried to squeeze MRS._DURSLEY to death.
but worst of all, for HARRY_POTTER at least, was PIERS_POLKISS calming down enough to say, "HARRY_POTTER was talking to the largest snake in the place, weren't you, HARRY_POTTER?"
UNCLE_VERNON waiTED until PIERS_POLKISS was safely out of the reptile housebefore starting on HARRY_POTTER.
UNCLE_VERNON was so angry UNCLE_VERNON could hardly speak.
UNCLE_VERNON managed to say, "go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before UNCLE_VERNON collapsed into a chair, and his AUNT_PETUNIA had to run and get UNCLE_VERNON a large brandy.
HARRY_POTTER lay in HARRY_POTTER dark cupboard much later, wishing HARRY_POTTER had a watch.
HARRY_POTTER didn't know what time it was and HARRY_POTTER couldn't be sure the DURSLEYS were asLEE_JORDANp yet.
until they were, HARRY_POTTER couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
HARRY_POTTER'd lived with the DURSLEYS almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as HARRY_POTTER could remember, ever since HARRY_POTTER'd been a baby and HARRY_POTTER parents had died in that car crash.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died.
sometimes, when HARRY_POTTER strained HARRY_POTTER memory during long hours in his dark cupboard, HARRY_POTTER came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on HARRY_POTTER forehead.
this, HARRY_POTTER supposed, was that car crash, though HARRY_POTTER couldn't imagine where all the green light came from.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't remember his parents at all.
HARRY_POTTER aunt and uncle never spoke about his aunt and uncle, and of course HARRY_POTTER was forbidden to ask questions.
there were no photographs of his aunt and uncle in the reptile house.
when HARRY_POTTER had been younger, HARRY_POTTER had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take HARRY_POTTER away, but it had never happened; the DURSLEYS were HARRY_POTTER only family.
yet sometimes HARRY_POTTER thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know HARRY_POTTER.
very strange strangers they were, too.
a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to a tiny man in a violet top hat once while out shopping with his AUNT_PETUNIA and MRS._DURSLEY.
after asking HARRY_POTTER furiously if a tiny man in a violet top hat knew a tiny man in a violet top hat, his AUNT_PETUNIA had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
a wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at a tiny man in a violet top hat once on a bus.
a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken a bald man in a very long purple coat hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.
the weirdest thing about all these people was the way all these people seemed to vanish HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER tried to get a closer look.
at school, HARRY_POTTER had no one.
everybody knew that MRS._DURSLEY's gang haTED that odd HARRY_POTTER in dudley's gang  baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with MRS._DURSLEY's gang.
chapter three.
the letters from no one.
the escape of the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR earned HARRY_POTTER the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR longest-ever punishment.
by the time the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR was allowed out of the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR cupboard again, the summer holidays had starTED and MRS._DURSLEY had already broken the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR new video camera, crashed the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR remote control airplane, and, first time out on the brazilian BOA_CONSTRICTOR racing bike, knocked down old mrs. FIGG as old mrs. FIGG crossed privet drive on old mrs. FIGG crutches.
HARRY_POTTER was glad school was over, but there was no escaping MRS._DURSLEY's gang, who visiTED the reptile house every single day.
PIERS_POLKISS, DENNIS, MALCOLM, and GORDON were all big and stupid, but as MRS._DURSLEY was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, MRS._DURSLEY was the leader.
the rest of PIERS_POLKISS, DENNIS, MALCOLM, and GORDON were all quite happy to join in MRS._DURSLEY's favorite sport: HARRY_HUNTING.
this was why HARRY_POTTER spent as much time as possible out of the reptile house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where HARRY_POTTER could see a tiny ray of hope.
when september came HARRY_POTTER would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in HARRY_POTTER life, HARRY_POTTER wouldn't be with MRS._DURSLEY.
MRS._DURSLEY had been accepTED at UNCLE_VERNON's old private school, SMELTINGS.
PIERS_POLKISS was going there too.
HARRY_POTTER, on the other hand, was going to stonewall high, the local public school.
MRS._DURSLEY thought this was very funny.
"they stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall," MRS._DURSLEY told HARRY_POTTER.
"want to come upstairs and practice?"
"no, thanks," said HARRY_POTTER.
"the poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down the poor toilet -- the poor toilet might be sick."
then MRS._DURSLEY ran, before MRS._DURSLEY could work out what MRS._DURSLEY'd said.
one day in july, his AUNT_PETUNIA took MRS._DURSLEY to lonDON to buy his AUNT_PETUNIA SMELTINGS uniform, leaving HARRY_POTTER at old mrs. FIGG's.
old mrs. FIGG wasn 't as bad as usual.
it turned out old mrs. FIGG'd broken old mrs. FIGG leg tripping over one of old mrs. FIGG cats, and old mrs. FIGG didn't seem quite as fond of her cats as before.
old mrs. FIGG let HARRY_POTTER watch television and gave HARRY_POTTER a bit of chocolate cake that tasTED as though old mrs. FIGG'd had it for several years.
that evening, MRS._DURSLEY paraded around the living room for the family in MRS._DURSLEY brand-new uniform.
SMELTINGS' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange kNICKerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters.
SMELTINGS' boys also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking.
this was supposed to be good training for later life.
as he looked at MRS._DURSLEY in he new kNICKerbockers, UNCLE_VERNONsaid gruffly that it was the proudest MOMent of he life.
his AUNT_PETUNIA burst into tears and said his AUNT_PETUNIA couldn't believe it was his AUNT_PETUNIA ICKLE_DUDLEYKINS, he looked so handsome and grown-up.
HARRY_POTTER didn't trust HARRY_POTTER to speak.
HARRY_POTTER thought two of HARRY_POTTER ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.
there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when HARRY_POTTER went in for breakfast.
it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.
HARRY_POTTER went to have a look.
a large metal tub in the sink was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.
"what's this?"
HARRY_POTTER asked his AUNT_PETUNIA.
his AUNT_PETUNIA lips tightened as they always did if HARRY_POTTER dared to ask a question.
"your new school uniform," his AUNT_PETUNIA said.
HARRY_POTTER looked in the bowl again.
"oh," HARRY_POTTER said, "i didn't realize it had to be so wet."
"dota be stupid," snapped his AUNT_PETUNIA.
"i'm dyeing some of MRS._DURSLEY's old things gray for HARRY_POTTER.
it'll look just like everyone else's when i've finished."
HARRY_POTTER seriously doubTED this, but thought this best not to argue.
HARRY_POTTER sat down at the table and tried not to think about how HARRY_POTTER was going to look on HARRY_POTTER first day at stonewall high -- like HARRY_POTTER was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.
MRS._DURSLEY and UNCLE_VERNON came in, both with wrinkled noses because of a horrible smell in the kitchen.
UNCLE_VERNON opened UNCLE_VERNON newspaper as usual and MRS._DURSLEY banged UNCLE_VERNON smelting stick, which UNCLE_VERNON carried everywhere, on the table.
dudley and UNCLE_VERNON heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.
"get the mail, MRS._DURSLEY," said UNCLE_VERNON from behind UNCLE_VERNON paper.
"make HARRY_POTTER get his paper."
"get the mail, dudley."
"make MRS._DURSLEY get his paper."
"poke MRS._DURSLEY with your smelting stick, mrs.
dursley."
HARRY_POTTER dodged your smelting stick, dudley and went to get the mail, dudley.
three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from UNCLE_VERNON sister MARGE, who was vacationing on the isle of WIGHT, a BROWN envelope that looked like a BILL, and -- a letter for HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER picked it up and stared at it, HARRY_POTTER heart twanging like a giant elastic band.
no one, ever, in HARRY_POTTER whole life, had written to HARRY_POTTER.
who would?
HARRY_POTTER had no friends, no other relatives -- HARRY_POTTER didn't belong to the library, so HARRY_POTTER'd never even got rude notes asking for books back.
yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
    mr. H._POTTER
    the cupboard under the stairs
    4 privet drive
    little whinging
    surrey
    the envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink.
there was no stamp.
turning the envelope over, HARRY_POTTER hand trembling, HARRY_POTTER saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter h.
    "hurry up, boy!"
shouTED UNCLE_VERNON from the kitchen.
"what are you doing, checking for letter bombs?"
HARRY_POTTER chuckled at HARRY_POTTER own joke.
HARRY_POTTER went back to the kitchen, still staring at a letter.
HARRY_POTTER handed UNCLE_VERNON the BILL and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the envelope.
UNCLE_VERNON ripped open the BILL, snorTED in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.
"MARGE's ill," MARGE informed his AUNT_PETUNIA.
"ate a funny whelk.
--."
"dad!"
said MRS._DURSLEY suddenly.
".
"dad, HARRY_POTTER's got something!"
HARRY_POTTER was on the point of unfolding HARRY_POTTER letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when the envelope was jerked sharply out of HARRY_POTTER hand by UNCLE_VERNON.
"that's mine!"
said HARRY_POTTER, trying to snatch the envelope back.
"who'd be writing to HARRY_POTTER?"
sneered UNCLE_VERNON, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
UNCLE_VERNON face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.
and it didn't stop there.
within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.
"p-p-PETUNIA!"
p-p-PETUNIA gasped.
MRS._DURSLEY tried to grab the letter to read it, but UNCLE_VERNONheld it high out of UNCLE_VERNON reach.
his AUNT_PETUNIA took it curiously and read the first line.
for a MOMent it looked as though his AUNT_PETUNIA might faint.
his AUNT_PETUNIA clutched his AUNT_PETUNIA throat and made a choking noise.
UNCLE_VERNONUNCLE_VERNON!
oh my goodness -- MRS._DURSLEY!"
they stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that HARRY_POTTER and MRS._DURSLEY were still in the room.
MRS._DURSLEY wasn't used to being ignored.
MRS._DURSLEY gave MRS._DURSLEY father a sharp tap on the head with MRS._DURSLEY smelting stick.
"i want to read the letter to read it," MRS._DURSLEY said loudly.
want to read the letter to read it," said HARRY_POTTER furiously, "as the letter to read it's mine."
"get out, both of you," crOAKed UNCLE_VERNON, stuffing the letter to read it back inside the letter to read it envelope.
HARRY_POTTER didn't move.
i want my letter!"
HARRY_POTTER shouTED.
"let me see it!"
demanded MRS._DURSLEY.
"out!"
roared UNCLE_VERNON, and UNCLE_VERNON took both HARRY_POTTER and dudley by the scruffs of HARRY_POTTER and dudley necks and threw the scruffs of their necks into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind the scruffs of their necks.
HARRY_POTTER and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; MRS._DURSLEY won, so HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on HARRY_POTTER sTOMach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
"MRS._DURSLEY," AUNT_PETUNIA was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the address -- how could HARRY_POTTER and dudley possibly know where HARRY_POTTER sLEE_JORDANps?
you DON't think HARRY_POTTER and dudley're watching the house?"
"watching -- spying -- might be following us,UNCLE_VERNON wildly.
"but what should us do, UNCLE_VERNON?
should us write back?
tell HARRY_POTTER and dudley us DON't want --"
    HARRY_POTTER could see UNCLE_VERNON shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.
"no," UNCLE_VERNON said finally.
"no, us'll ignore it.
if they DON't get an answer...
yes, that's best... us won't do anything....
    "but --"
    "i'm not having one in the house, PETUNIA!
didn't us swear when us took UNCLE_VERNON in us'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"
that evening when UNCLE_VERNON got back from work, UNCLE_VERNON did something UNCLE_VERNON'd never DONe before; UNCLE_VERNON visiTED HARRY_POTTER in UNCLE_VERNON cupboard.
"where's a letter?"
said HARRY_POTTER, the MOMent UNCLE_VERNON had squeezed through the kitchen door behind them.
"who's writing to me?"
"no one.
no one was addressed to you by mistake," said UNCLE_VERNONshortly.
"i have burned no one."
"it was not a mistake," said HARRY_POTTER angrily, "it had his cupboarDON it."
"silence!"
yelled UNCLE_VERNON, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling.
UNCLE_VERNON took a few deep breaths and then forced UNCLE_VERNON face into a smile, which looked quite painful.
"er -- yes, HARRY_POTTER -- about his cupboard.
your aunt and i have been thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into MRS._DURSLEY's second bedroom.
"why?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"DON't ask questions!"
snapped HARRY_POTTER uncle.
"take this stuff upstairs, now."
the DURSLEYS' house had four bedrooms: one for UNCLE_VERNONand AUNT_PETUNIA, one for visitors (usually UNCLE_VERNON sister, MARGE), one where MRS._DURSLEY slept, and one where MRS._DURSLEY kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into MRS._DURSLEY first bedroom.
it only took HARRY_POTTER one trip upstairs to move everything HARRY_POTTER owned from the cupboard to this room.
HARRY_POTTER sat down on the bed and stared around HARRY_POTTER.
nearly everything in here was broken.
the month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank MRS._DURSLEY had once driven over the NEXT_DOOR neighbor's dog; in the corner was MRS._DURSLEY's first-ever television set, which MRS._DURSLEY'd put MRS._DURSLEY foot through when MRS._DURSLEY favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that MRS._DURSLEY had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because MRS._DURSLEYhad sat on it.
other shelves were full of books.
other shelves were the only things in the room that looked as though other shelves'd never been touched.
from downstairs came the sound of MRS._DURSLEY bawling at MRS._DURSLEY MOTHER, i DON't want MRS._DURSLEY in there...
i need that room... make MRS._DURSLEY get out...."
    HARRY_POTTER sighed and stretched out on the bed.
yesterday "
    HARRY_POTTER'd have given anything to be up here.
today "
    HARRY_POTTER'd rather be back in "
    HARRY_POTTER cupboard with that letter than up here without his cupboard.
next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet.
MRS._DURSLEY was in shock.
MRS._DURSLEY'd screamed, whacked his father with MRS._DURSLEY smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his MOTHER, and thrown MRS._DURSLEY tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and MRS._DURSLEY still didn't have MRS._DURSLEY room back.
HARRY_POTTER was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing HARRY_POTTER'd opened the letter in the hall.
UNCLE_VERNON and AUNT_PETUNIA kept looking at each other darkly.
when the mail, dudley arrived, UNCLE_VERNON, who seemed to be trying to be nice to HARRY_POTTER, made MRS._DURSLEY go and get the mail, dudley.
UNCLE_VERNON, who seemed to be trying to  heard MRS._DURSLEY banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall.
then MRS._DURSLEY shouTED, "there's another one!
'mr.
H._POTTER, the smallest bedroom, 4 privet drive --'"
    with a strangled cry, UNCLE_VERNON leapt from UNCLE_VERNON seat and ran down the hall, HARRY_POTTER right behind UNCLE_VERNON.
UNCLE_VERNON had to wrestle MRS._DURSLEY to the ground to get the letter from UNCLE_VERNON, which was made difficult by the fact that HARRY_POTTER had grabbed UNCLE_VERNONaround the neck from behind.
after a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick, UNCLE_VERNONstraightened up, gasping for breath, with HARRY_POTTER's letter clutched in UNCLE_VERNON hand.
"go to your cupboard -- i mean, your bedroom," UNCLE_VERNON wheezed atHARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER.
"MRS._DURSLEY go -- just go."
HARRY_POTTER walked round and round his room back.
someone knew someone had moved out of someone and they seemed to know someone hadn't received someone first letter.
surely that meant they'd try again?
and this time someone'd make sure they didn't fail.
someone had a plan.
the repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning.
HARRY_POTTER turned it off quickly and dressed silently.
HARRY_POTTER mustn't wake the DURSLEYS'.
HARRY_POTTER stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
HARRY_POTTER was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first.
HARRY_POTTER heart hammered as HARRY_POTTER crept across the dark hall toward the front door --
    HARRY_POTTER leapt into the air; HARRY_POTTER'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!
lights clicked on upstairs and to HARRY_POTTER horror HARRY_POTTER realized that the big, squashy something had been HARRY_POTTER uncle's face.
UNCLE_VERNONhad been lying at the foot of the front door in a sLEE_JORDANping bag, clearly making sure that HARRY_POTTER didn't do exactly what HARRY_POTTER'd been trying to do.
HARRY_POTTER shouTED at HARRY_POTTER for about half an hour and then told HARRY_POTTER to go and make a cup of tea.
HARRY_POTTER shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time HARRY_POTTER got back, the mail, dudley had arrived, right into UNCLE_VERNON lap.
HARRY_POTTER could see three letters addressed in green ink.
i want --" HARRY_POTTER began, but UNCLE_VERNON was tearing three letters addressed in green inkinto pieces before UNCLE_VERNON eyes.
UNCLE_VERNON didnt go to work that day.
UNCLE_VERNON stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
"see," UNCLE_VERNON explained to his AUNT_PETUNIA through a mouthful of nails, "if they can't deliver they they'll just give up."
"i'm not sure that'll work, UNCLE_VERNON."
"oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, his AUNT_PETUNIA, these people's minds're not like you and me," said UNCLE_VERNON, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake his AUNT_PETUNIA had just brought UNCLE_VERNON.
on friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for HARRY_POTTER.
as no less than twelve letters couldn't go through the mail slot no less than twelve letters had been pushed under the door, slotTED through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.
UNCLE_VERNON stayed at home again.
after burning all the letters, UNCLE_VERNON got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.
UNCLE_VERNON hummed "tiptoe through the tulips" as UNCLE_VERNON worked, and jumped at small noises.
on saturday, things began to get out of hand.
twenty-four letters to HARRY_POTTER found twenty-four letters to HARRY_POTTER way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that twenty-four letters to HARRY_POTTER very confused milkman had handed his AUNT_PETUNIA through the living room window.
while UNCLE_VERNON made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, his AUNT_PETUNIA shredded the letters in his AUNT_PETUNIA food processor.
"who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?"
MRS._DURSLEY asked HARRY_POTTER in amazement.
on sunday morning, UNCLE_VERNON sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.
"no post on sundays," UNCLE_VERNON reminded them cheerfully as UNCLE_VERNON spread marmalade on UNCLE_VERNON newspapers, "no damn letters today --"
    something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as UNCLE_VERNON spoke and caught UNCLE_VERNON sharply on the back of the head.
next MOMent, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets.
the DURSLEYS ducked, but HARRY_POTTER leapt into the air trying to catch one.
"out!
out!"
UNCLE_VERNON seized HARRY_POTTER around the waist and threw HARRY_POTTER into the hall.
when his AUNT_PETUNIA and MRS._DURSLEY had run out with AUNT_PETUNIA and dudley arms over AUNT_PETUNIA and dudley faces, UNCLE_VERNON slammed the door shut.
AUNT_PETUNIA and dudley could hear twenty-four letters to HARRY_POTTER still streaming into his room back, bouncing off the walls and floor.
"that does it," said UNCLE_VERNON, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of UNCLE_VERNON mustache at the same time.
i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave.
we're going away.
just pack some clothes.
no arguments!"
he looked so dangerous with half he mustache missing that no one dared argue.
ten minutes later they had wrenched they way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.
MRS._DURSLEY was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit MRS._DURSLEY round the head for holding they up while MRS._DURSLEY tried to pack MRS._DURSLEY television, vcr, and computer in MRS._DURSLEY sports bag.
they drove.
and they drove.
his AUNT_PETUNIA didn't dare ask where they were going.
every now and then UNCLE_VERNON would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.
"shake'em off... shake 'em off," shake'em would mutter whenever shake'em did this.
they didn't stop to eat or drink all day.
by MRS._DURSLEY MRS._DURSLEY was howling.
shake'em'd never had such a bad day in shake'em life.
shake'em was hungry, shake'em'd missed five television programs shake'em'd wanTED to see, and shake'em'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on shake'em computer.
UNCLE_VERNON stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.
MRS._DURSLEY and HARRY_POTTER shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
MRS._DURSLEY snored but HARRY_POTTER stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....
    dudley and HARRY_POTTER ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned TOMatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
dudley and HARRY_POTTER had just finished when the owner of a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city came over to dudley and HARRY_POTTER table.
"'scuse me, but is one of you mr. H._POTTER?
only i got about an 'undred of these at the front desk."
the woman held up a letter so dudley and HARRY_POTTER could read the green ink address:
    mr. H._POTTER
    room 17
    railview hotel
    cokeworth
    HARRY_POTTER made a grab for a letter but UNCLE_VERNON knocked UNCLE_VERNON hand out of the way.
the woman stared.
"i'll take his hand," said UNCLE_VERNON, standing up quickly and following the woman from the dining room.
wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"
his AUNT_PETUNIAsuggesTED timidly, hours later, but UNCLE_VERNON didn't seem to hear the woman.
exactly what UNCLE_VERNON was looking for, none of his hand knew.
UNCLE_VERNON drove his hand into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook UNCLE_VERNON head, got back in the car, and off his hand went again.
the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.
"daddy's gone mad, hasn't UNCLE_VERNON?"
MRS._DURSLEY asked his AUNT_PETUNIA dully late that afternoon.
UNCLE_VERNON had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
it starTED to rain.
great drops beat on the roof of the car.
dud ley sniveled.
"it's monday," he told he MOTHER.
"the great humberto's on tonight.
i want to stay somewhere with a television. "
monday.
this reminded HARRY_POTTER of something.
if it was monday -- and you could usually count on MRS._DURSLEY to know the days the week, because of television -- then TOMorrow, tuesday, was HARRY_POTTER's eleventh birthday.
of course, HARRY_POTTER birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the DURSLEYS' had GIVEN_HARRY a coat hanger and a pair of uncle UNCLE_VERNON's old socks.
still, you weren't eleven every day.
UNCLE_VERNON was back and UNCLE_VERNON was smiling.
UNCLE_VERNON was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer his AUNT_PETUNIA when his AUNT_PETUNIA asked what UNCLE_VERNON'd bought.
"found the perfect place!"
UNCLE_VERNON said.
"come on!
everyone out!"
it was very cold outside the car.
UNCLE_VERNON was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.
perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.
one thing was certain, there was no television in there.
"storm forecast for tonight!"
said UNCLE_VERNON gLEE_JORDANfully, clapping UNCLE_VERNON hands together.
"and this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us this gentleman boat!"
a toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.
"i've already got us some rations," said UNCLE_VERNON, "so all aboard!"
it was freezing in his boat.
icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.
after what seemed like hours their reached the rock, where UNCLE_VERNON, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
the inside was horrible; the inside smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the WOODen walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.
there were only two rooms.
UNCLE_VERNON rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.
UNCLE_VERNON tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
"could do with some of those letters now, eh?"
UNCLE_VERNON said cheerfully.
UNCLE_VERNON was in a very good mood.
obviously UNCLE_VERNON thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.
HARRY_POTTERprivately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer UNCLE_VERNON up at all.
as night fell, a storm blew up around them.
spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.
his AUNT_PETUNIA found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for MRS._DURSLEY on the moth-eaten sofa.
his AUNT_PETUNIA and UNCLE_VERNON went off to the lumpy bed NEXT_DOOR, and HARRY_POTTER was left to find the softest bit of floor HARRY_POTTER could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
a storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't sLEE_JORDANp.
HARRY_POTTER shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, HARRY_POTTER sTOMach rumbling with hunger.
MRS._DURSLEY's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that starTED near midnight.
the lighTED dial of MRS._DURSLEY's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on HARRY_POTTER fat wrist, told HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.
HARRY_POTTER lay and watched HARRY_POTTER birthday tick nearer, wondering if the DURSLEYS would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
five minutes to go.
HARRY_POTTER heard something creak outside.
HARRY_POTTER hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although HARRY_POTTER might be warmer if the roof did.
four minutes to go.
maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that HARRY_POTTER'd be able to steal one somehow.
three minutes to go.
was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that?
and (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise?
was the rock crumbling into sea?
one minute to go and HARRY_POTTER'd be eleven.
thirty seconds... twenty ... ten... nine -- maybe HARRY_POTTER'd wake MRS._DURSLEY, just to annoy HARRY_POTTER -- three... two... one...
    boom.
the whole shack shivered and HARRY_POTTER sat bolt upright, staring at the door.
someone was outside, knocking to come in.
chapter four.
the keeper of the keys.
boom.
they knocked again.
MRS._DURSLEY jerked awake.
"where's the cannon?"
MRS._DURSLEY said stupidly.
there was a crash behind they and UNCLE_VERNON came skidding into his room back.
UNCLE_VERNON was holding a rifle in UNCLE_VERNON hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package UNCLE_VERNON had brought with they.
"who's there?"
UNCLE_VERNON shouTED.
"i warn you -- i'm armed!"
there was a pause.
then --
    smash!
the door was hit with such force that the door swung clean off the door hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
a giant of a man was standing in the doorway.
a giant of a man face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out a giant of a man eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.
a giant of a man squeezed a giant of a man way into the hut, stooping so that a giant of a man head just brushed the ceiling.
a giant of a man bent down, picked up the door, and fitTED the door easily back into the door frame.
the noise of the storm outside dropped a little.
a giant of a man turned to look at them all.
"couldn't make them all a cup o' tea, could YEH?
it's not been an easy journey..."
    a giant of a man strode over to the sofa where MRS._DURSLEY sat frozen with fear.
"budge up, YEH great lump," said the stranger.
MRS._DURSLEY squeaked and ran to hide behind MRS._DURSLEY MOTHER, who was crouching, terrified, behind UNCLE_VERNON.
"an' here's HARRY_POTTER!"
said a giant of a man.
HARRY_POTTER looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
"las' time i saw you, you was only a baby," said a giant of a man.
"YEH look a lot like yet dad, but YEH  got yet MOM's eyes."
UNCLE_VERNON made a funny rasping noise.
i demand that you leave at once, sit!"
YEH said.
"you are breaking and entering!"
"ah, shut up, dursley, YEH great prune," said a giant of a man; he reached over the back of the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear, jerked the gun out of uncle "
    UNCLE_VERNON's hands, bent the gun into a knot as easily as if the gun had been made of rubber, and threw the gun into a corner of the room.
UNCLE_VERNON made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
"anyway -- HARRY_POTTER," said a giant of a man, turning HARRY_POTTER back on the DURSLEYS, "a very happy birthday to YEH.
got summat for YEH  -- i mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right."
from an inside pocket of YEH black overcoat YEH pulled a slightly squashed box.
HARRY_POTTER opened a slightly squashed box with trembling fingers.
inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday HARRY_POTTER written on it in green icing.
HARRY_POTTER looked up at a giant of a man.
HARRY_POTTER meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to HARRY_POTTER mouth, and what HARRY_POTTER said instead was, "who are you?a giant of a man chuckled.
"true, i haven't introduced meself.
MR._HAGRID, keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts."
HARRY_POTTER held out an enormous hand and shook HARRY_POTTER's whole arm.
"what about that tea then, eh?"
HARRY_POTTER said, rubbing HARRY_POTTER hands together.
"i'd not say no ter summat stronger if YEH've got YEH've, mind."
HARRY_POTTER eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in his eyes and HARRY_POTTER snorTED.
HARRY_POTTER bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what HARRY_POTTER was doing but when HARRY_POTTER drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there.
a roaring fire filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and HARRY_POTTER felt the warmth wash over HARRY_POTTER as though HARRY_POTTER'd sunk into a hot bath.
a giant of a man sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under HARRY_POTTER weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of HARRY_POTTER coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that HARRY_POTTER took a swig from before starting to make tea.
soon the whole damp hutwas full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage.
nobody said a thing while a giant of a man was working, but as HARRY_POTTER slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, MRS._DURSLEY fidgeTED a little.
UNCLE_VERNON said sharply, "DON't touch anything UNCLE_VERNON gives you, mrs.
dursley."
a giant of a man chuckled darkly.
"yet great puddin' of a son DON' need fattenin' anymore, dursley, DON' worry."
MRS._DURSLEY passed the sausages to HARRY_POTTER, who was so hungry MRS._DURSLEY had never tasTED anything so wonderful, but MRS._DURSLEY still couldn't take MRS._DURSLEY eyes off a giant of a man.
finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, MRS._DURSLEY said, "i'm sorry, but i still DON't really know who you are."
a giant of a man took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of MRS._DURSLEY hand.
"call me hagrid," MRS._DURSLEY said, "everyone does.
an' like i told YEH, i'm keeper of keys at hogwarts -- YEH'll know all about hogwarts, o' course.
"er -- no," said HARRY_POTTER.
me hagrid looked shocked.
"sorry,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER said quickly.
"sony?"
barked me hagrid, turning to stare at the DURSLEYS, who shrank back into the shadows.
"it' s them as should be sorry!
i knew YEH weren't gettin' yer letters but i never thought YEH wouldn't even know abou' hogwarts, for cryin' out loud!
did YEH never wonder where yet parents learned it all?"
"all what?"
asked HARRY_POTTER.
"all what?"
me hagrid thundered.
"now wait jus' one second!"
he had leapt to he feet.
in he anger he seemed to fill the whole damp hut.
the DURSLEYS were cowering against the wall.
"do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the DURSLEYS, "that this boy -- this boy!
-- knows nothin' abou' -- about anything?"
HARRY_POTTER thought this was going a bit far. "
HARRY_POTTER had been to school, after all, and "
    HARRY_POTTER marks weren't bad.
"i know some things," "
    HARRY_POTTER said.
"i can, you know, do math and stuff."
but me hagrid simply waved "
    HARRY_POTTER hand and said, "about our world, i mean.
our world.
our world.
our world."
"our world?"
hagrid looked as if "
    hagrid was about to explode.
"dursley!"
"
    hagrid boomed.
UNCLE_VERNON, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like "mimblewimble."
me hagrid stared wildly at HARRY_POTTER.
"but "
    hagrid must know about yet MOM and dad," "
    hagrid said.
"i mean, they're famous.
you're famous."
"what?
my -- yet MOM and dad weren't famous, were yet MOM and dad?"
"YEH DON' know... YEH DON' know..." me hagrid ran me hagrid fingers through me hagrid hair, fixing HARRY_POTTER with a bewildered stare.
"YEH DON' know what YEH are?"
YEH said finally.
UNCLE_VERNON suddenly found YEH voice.
"stop!"
the boy commanded.
"stop right there, sit!
i forbid you to tell the boy anything!"
a braver man than MRS._DURSLEY would have quailed under the furious look me hagrid now gave the boy; when me hagrid spoke, the boy every syllable trembled with rage.
"you never told the boy?
never told the boy what was in the letter the boy left for the boy?
i was there!
i saw the boy leave the letter , dursley!
an' you've kept the letter  from the boy all these years?"
"kept what from me?"
said HARRY_POTTER eagerly.
"stop!
i forbid you!"
yelled UNCLE_VERNON in panic.
AUNT_PETUNIA gave a gasp of horror.
"ah, go boil yet heads, both of YEH," said me hagrid.
"HARRY_POTTER -- yet a wizard."
there was silence inside the whole damp hut.
only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.
    "
-- a what?"
gasped HARRY_POTTER.
"a wizard, o' course," said me hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, i'd say, once YEH've been trained up a bit.
with a mum an' dad like yours, what else would YEH be?
an' i reckon it's abou' time YEH read yer letter."
HARRY_POTTER stretched out "
    HARRY_POTTER hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to mr. H._POTTER, the floor, HUT-ON-THE-ROCK, the sea. "
HARRY_POTTER pulled out the letter  and read:
    hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
    headmaster: ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE
    (order of MERLIN, first class, GRANd sorc., chf.
WARLOCK, supreme mugwump, international confed.
of wizards)
    dear mr. POTTER,
    we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepTED at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.
please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
term begins on september 1.
we await your owl by no later than july 31.
yours sincerely,
    MINERVA_MCGONAGALL,
    deputy headmistress
    questions exploded inside HARRY_POTTER's head like fireworks and deputy headmistress
    questions couldn't decide which to ask first.
after a few minutes deputy headmistress
    questions stammered, "what does it mean, they await your owl?"
"gallopin' gorgons, that reminds me," said me hagrid, clapping a hand to me hagrid forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside me hagrid overcoat me hagrid pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
with me hagrid tongue between me hagrid teeth me hagrid scribbled a note that HARRY_POTTER could read upside down:
    the boy,
    GIVEN_HARRY the letter .
taking HARRY_POTTER to buy HARRY_POTTER things TOMorrow.
weather's horrible.
hope you're well.
hagrid
    hagrid rolled up the note, gave hagrid
    hagrid to the owl, which clamped hagrid
    hagrid in hagrid
    hagrid beak, went to the door, and threw your owl out into the storm.
then HARRY_POTTER came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
HARRY_POTTER realized his mouth was open and closed his mouth quickly.
"where was i?"
said me hagrid, but at that MOMent, UNCLE_VERNON, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
"HARRY_POTTER's not going," HARRY_POTTER said.
me hagrid grunTED.
"i'd like ter see a great muggle like you stop HARRY_POTTER," HARRY_POTTER said.
"a what?"
said HARRY_POTTER, interesTED.
"a muggle," said me hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
an' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on."
"we swore when we took HARRY_POTTER in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said UNCLE_VERNON, "swore we'd stamp that rubbish out of HARRY_POTTER!
wizard indeed!"
"you knew?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"you knew i'm a -- a wizard?"
"knew!"
shrieked AUNT_PETUNIA suddenly.
"knew!
of course we knew!
how could you not be, my dratTED sister being what my dratTED sister was?
oh, my dratTED sister got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with my dratTED sister pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats.
i was the only one who saw my dratTED sister for what my dratTED sister was -- a freak!
but for my MOTHER and father, oh no, it was LILY this and LILY that, my MOTHER and father were proud of having a witch in the family!"
my dratTED sister stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on.
it seemed my dratTED sister had been wanting to say all this for years.
"then my dratTED sister met that POTTER at school and my MOTHER and father left and got married and had you, and of course i knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, my dratTED sister went and got my dratTED sister blown up and we got landed with my dratTED sister!"
HARRY_POTTER had gone very white.
as soon as "
    HARRY_POTTER found "
    HARRY_POTTER voice "
    HARRY_POTTER said, "blown up?
you told me they died in a car crash!"
"car crash!"
roared me hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the DURSLEYS scuttled back to they corner.
"how could a car crash kill LILY an' JAMES_POTTER?
it's an outrage!
a scandal!
POTTER at schoolnot knowin' HARRY_POTTER own story when every kid in our world knows POTTER at school name!"
"but why?
what happened?"
HARRY_POTTER asked urgently.
the anger faded from me hagrid's face.
HARRY_POTTER looked suddenly anxious.
"i never expecTED this," HARRY_POTTER said, in a low, worried voice.
"i had no idea, when the boy told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of YEH, how much YEH didn't know.
ah, HARRY_POTTER, i DON' know if i'm the right person ter tell YEH -- but someone 3 s gotta -- YEH can't go off ter hogwarts not knowin'."
HARRY_POTTER threw a dirty look at the DURSLEYS.
"well, it's best YEH know as much as i can tell YEH -- mind, i can't tell YEH everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."
    HARRY_POTTER sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "it begins, i suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible YEH DON't know a person called name, everyone in our world knows --"
    "who? "
"well -- i DON' like sayin' the name if i can help it.
no one does."
"why not?"
"gulpin' garGOYLEs, HARRY_POTTER, people are still scared.
blimey, this is difficult.
see, there was this wizard who went... bad.
as bad as you could go.
worse.
worse than worse.
his name was..."
    hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
"could you write his name down?"
HARRY_POTTER suggesTED.
"nah -can't spell his name.
all right -- VOLDEMORT. "
"
    hagridshuddered.
"DON' make me say it again.
anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, starTED lookin' for followers.
got 'em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanTED a bit o' a bit o' power, 'cause a bit o' was gettin' himself power, all right.
dark days, HARRY_POTTER.
didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened.
a bit o' was takin' over.
'course, some stood up to a bit o' -- an' a bit o' killed 'em.
horribly.
one o' the only safe places left was hogwarts.
reckon dumbledore's the only one YOU-KNOW-who was afraid of.
didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.
"now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as i ever knew.
head boy an' girl at hogwarts in their day!
suppose the myst'ry is why YOU-KNOW-who never tried to get 'em on the myst'ry side before... probably knew they were too close ter the boy ter want anythin' ter do with the dark side.
"maybe a bit o' thought a bit o' could persuade they... maybe a bit o' just wanTED they outta the way.
all anyone knows is, a bit o' turned up in the village where you was all living, on halloween ten years ago.
you was just a year old.
a bit o' came ter yer house an' -- an' "
    hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotTED handkerchief and blew "
    hagrid nose with a sound like a foghorn.
"sorry," "
    hagrid said.
"but it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people YEH couldn't find -- anyway..."
    "YOU-KNOW-who killed 'em.
an' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- a bit o' tried to kill you, too.
wanTED ter make a clean job of it, i suppose, or maybe a bit o' just liked killin' by then.
but a bit o' couldn't do it.
never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead?
that was no ordinary cut.
that's what YEH get when a powerful, evil curse touches YEH -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but an' dad an' yer house didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, HARRY_POTTER.
no one ever lived after HARRY_POTTER decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' an'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age -- the mckinnons, the bones, the prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived."
something very painful was going on in HARRY_POTTER's mind.
as hagrid's story came to a close, an saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than an had ever remembered it before -- and an remembered something else, for the first time in an life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.
me hagrid was watching an sadly.
"took YEH from the ruined house myself, on the boy's orders.
brought YEH ter this lot..."
    "load of old tosh," said UNCLE_VERNON.
HARRY_POTTER jumped; HARRY_POTTER had almost forgotten that the DURSLEYS were there.
UNCLE_VERNON certainly seemed to have got back UNCLE_VERNON courage.
UNCLE_VERNON was glaring at me hagrid and UNCLE_VERNON fists were clenched.
"now, you listen here, boy," UNCLE_VERNON snarled, "i accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, your parents,  were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without your parents,  in my opinion -- asked for all your parents,  got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what i expecTED, always knew your parents, 'd come to a sticky end --"
    but at that MOMent, me hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside me hagrid coat.
pointing this at UNCLE_VERNON like a sword, me hagrid said, "i'm warning you, dursley -i'm warning you -- one more word... "
    in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, UNCLE_VERNON courage failed again; UNCLE_VERNON flattened UNCLE_VERNON against the wall and fell silent.
"that's better," said me hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
HARRY_POTTER, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of questions to ask.
"but what happened to vol--, sorry -- i mean, YOU-KNOW-who?"
"good question, HARRY_POTTER.
disappeared.
vanished.
same night HARRY_POTTER tried ter kill you.
makes YEH even more famous.
that's the biggest myst'ry, see... HARRY_POTTER was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd HARRY_POTTER go?
"some say HARRY_POTTER died.
codswallop, in my opinion.
dunno if HARRY_POTTER had enough human left in HARRY_POTTER to die.
some say HARRY_POTTER's still out there, bidin' HARRY_POTTER time, like, but i DON' believe it.
people who was on HARRY_POTTER side came back ter ours.
some of people who was on his side came outta kinda trances.
DON~ reckon some of 'em could've DONe if HARRY_POTTER was comin' back.
"most of us reckon HARRY_POTTER's still out there somewhere but lost HARRY_POTTER powers.
too weak to carry on.
'cause somethin' about you finished him, HARRY_POTTER.
there was somethin' goin' on that night him hadn't counTED on -- i dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all right."
hagrid looked at HARRY_POTTER with warmth and respect blazing in HARRY_POTTER eyes, but HARRY_POTTER, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
a wizard?
him?
how could him possibly be?
him'd spent him life being clouTED by dudley, and bullied by AUNT_PETUNIA and UNCLE_VERNON; if him was really a wizard, why hadn't he was really a wizard been turned into warty toads every time he was really a wizard'd tried to lock him in him cupboard?
if him'd once defeaTED the greatest sorcerer in our world, how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?
    "
hagrid," him said quietly, "i think you must have made a mistake.
i DON't think i can be a wizard."
to him surprise, me hagrid chuckled.
"not a wizard, eh?
never made things happen when you was scared or angry?"
HARRY_POTTER looked into the fire.
now "
    HARRY_POTTER came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made "
    HARRY_POTTER aunt and uncle furious with "
    HARRY_POTTER had happened when "
    HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER, had been upset or angry... chased by dudley's gang, "
    HARRY_POTTER had somehow found "
    HARRY_POTTER out of he, HARRY_POTTER, reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, "
    HARRY_POTTER'd managed to make that ridiculous haircut grow back... and the very last time dudley had hit "
    HARRY_POTTER, hadn't "
    HARRY_POTTER got "
    HARRY_POTTER revenge, without even realizing "
    HARRY_POTTER was doing it?
hadn't "
    HARRY_POTTER set a BOA_CONSTRICTOR on "
    HARRY_POTTER?
HARRY_POTTER looked back at me hagrid, smiling, and saw that me hagrid was positively beaming at HARRY_POTTER.
"see?"
said me hagrid.
"HARRY_POTTER, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at hogwarts."
but UNCLE_VERNON wasn't going to give in without a fight.
"haven't i told you UNCLE_VERNON's not going?"
UNCLE_VERNON hissed.
"UNCLE_VERNON's going to stonewall high and UNCLE_VERNON'll be grateful for it.
i've read those letters and UNCLE_VERNON needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --"
    "if UNCLE_VERNON wants ter go, a great muggle like you won't stop UNCLE_VERNON," growled me hagrid.
"stop LILY an' JAMES_POTTER' s son goin' hogwarts!
yer mad.
hogwarts name's been down ever since hogwarts was born.
hogwarts's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.
seven years there and hogwarts won't know hogwarts.
hogwarts'll be with youngsters of hogwarts own sort, for a change, an' hogwarts'll be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE--"
    "i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!"
yelled UNCLE_VERNON.
but hogwarts had finally gone too far.
me hagrid seized hogwarts umbrella and whirled his umbrella over hogwarts head, "never," hogwarts thundered, "- insult- ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE- dumbledore- in- front- of- me!"
hogwarts brought his umbrella -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, dudley was dancing on the spot with dudley hands clasped over dudley fat botTOM, howling in pain.
when hogwarts turned hogwarts back on them, HARRY_POTTER saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in HARRY_POTTER trousers.
UNCLE_VERNON roared.
pulling AUNT_PETUNIA and dudley into the other room, UNCLE_VERNON cast one last terrified look at me hagrid and slammed the door behind AUNT_PETUNIA and dudley.
me hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked me hagrid beard.
"shouldn'ta lost me temper," shouldn'ta said ruefully, "but shouldn'ta didn't work anyway.
meant ter turn shouldn'ta into a pig, but i suppose shouldn'ta was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do."
shouldn'ta cast a sideways look at HARRY_POTTER under shouldn'ta bushy eyebrows.
"be grateful if YEH didn't mention that ter anyone at hogwarts," YEH said.
"i'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'.
i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow YEH an' get yer letters to YEH an' stuff -- one o' the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job
    "why aren't you supposed to do magic?"
asked HARRY_POTTER.
"oh, well -- i was at hogwarts meself but i -- er -- got expelled, ter tell YEH the truth.
in me third year.
they snapped me wand in half an' everything.
but dumbledore's  let me stay on as gamekeeper.
great man, dumbledore's ."
"why were you expelled?"
"it's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do TOMorrow," said me hagrid loudly.
"gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."
dumbledore's  took off his coat and threw his coat to HARRY_POTTER.
"you can kip under that," dumbledore's  said.
"DON' mind if it wriggles a bit, i think i still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets."
chapter five.
DIAGON_ALLEY.
HARRY_POTTER woke early the next morning.
although HARRY_POTTER could tell it was daylight, HARRY_POTTER kept HARRY_POTTER eyes shut tight.
"it was a dream, HARRY_POTTER told HARRY_POTTER firmly.
"i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards.
when i open his eyes i'll be at home in his cupboard."
there was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
and there's AUNT_PETUNIA knocking on the door, HARRY_POTTER thought, HARRY_POTTER heart sinking.
but HARRY_POTTER still didn't open his eyes.
it had been such a good dream.
tap.
tap.
tap.
"all right," HARRY_POTTER mumbled, "i'm getting up."
HARRY_POTTER sat up and hagrid's heavy coat fell off HARRY_POTTER.
the hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, me hagrid was asLEE_JORDANp on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping the hut claw on the window, a newspaper held in the hut beak.
HARRY_POTTER scrambled to HARRY_POTTER feet, so happy HARRY_POTTER felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER went straight to the window and jerked the window  open.
an owl rapping its claw on the window swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid, who didn't wake up.
an owl rapping its claw on the window then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid's coat.
"DON't do that."
HARRY_POTTER tried to wave an owl rapping its claw on the window out of the way, but an owl rapping its claw on the window snapped its beak and carried on savaging hagrid's coat.
"hagrid!"
said HARRY_POTTER loudly.
"there's an owl
    "pay an owl
    ," hagrid grunTED into the collapsed sofa.
"what?"
"an owl
     wants payin' for deliverin' the paper.
look in the pockets."
" hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, HARRY_POTTER pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
"give HARRY_POTTER five KNUTS," said " hagrid sLEE_JORDANpily.
"KNUTS?"
"the little bronze ones."
HARRY_POTTER counTED out five little bronze coins, and an owl rapping its claw on the window held out "
    HARRY_POTTER leg so HARRY_POTTER could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to the money.
then HARRY_POTTER flew off through the open window.
me hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
"best be off, HARRY_POTTER, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter lonDON an' buy all yer stuff for school."
HARRY_POTTER was turning over five little bronze coins and looking at five little bronze coins.
HARRY_POTTER had just thought of something that made HARRY_POTTER feel as though the happy balloon inside HARRY_POTTER had got a puncture.
"um -- hagrid?"
"mm?"
said hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
"i haven't got any money -- and you heard UNCLE_VERNON last night ... UNCLE_VERNON won't pay for me to go and learn magic."
"DON't worry about that," said me hagrid, standing up and scratching me hagrid head.
"d'YEH think yer parents didn't leave YEH anything?"
"but if yer parents house was destroyed --"
    "they didn' keep yer parents gold in their house, boy!
nah, first stop fer us is GRINGOTTS.
wizards' bank.
have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' i wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."
"wizards have banks?"
"just the one.
GRINGOTTS.
run by goblins."
HARRY_POTTER dropped the bit of sausage "
    HARRY_POTTER was holding.
"goblins?"
"yeah -- so YEH'd be mad ter try an' rob it, i'll tell YEHthat.
never mess with goblins, HARRY_POTTER.
GRINGOTTS is the safest place in our world for anything YEH want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe hogwarts.
as a matter o' fact, i gotta visit GRINGOTTS anyway.
dumbledore's .
hogwarts business."
me hagrid drew me hagrid up proudly.
"me hagrid usually gets me ter do important stuff for me hagrid.
FETCHIN' you gettin' things from GRINGOTTS -- knows FETCHIN' you gettin' things from GRINGOTTS -- can trust me, see.
"got everythin'?
come on, then."
HARRY_POTTER followed me hagrid out onto the rock.
the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.
UNCLE_VERNONhad hired was still there, with a lot of water in the botTOM after the storm.
"how did you get here?"
HARRY_POTTER asked, looking around for another boat.
"flew," said me hagrid.
"flew?"
"yeah -- but we'll go back in this.
not s'pposed ter use magic now i've got YEH."
they settled down in another boat, HARRY_POTTER still staring at me hagrid, trying to imagine HARRY_POTTER flying.
"seems a shame ter row, though," said me hagrid, giving "
    HARRY_POTTERanother of "
    HARRY_POTTER sideways looks.
"if i was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would YEH mind not mentionin' it at hogwarts?"
"of course not," said HARRY_POTTER, eager to see more magic.
me hagridpulled out his umbrella again, tapped his umbrella twice on the side of the boat, and his umbrella sped off toward land.
"why would you be mad to try and rob GRINGOTTS?HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER asked.
"spells -- enchantments," said me hagrid, unfolding me hagrid newspaper as me hagrid spoke.
"they say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults.
and then YEH gotta find yer way -- GRINGOTTS is hundreds of miles under lonDON, see.
deep under the underground.
YEH'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if YEH did manage ter get yer hands on summat."
HARRY_POTTER sat and thought about this while me hagrid read HARRY_POTTER newspaper, the daily PROPHET.
HARRY_POTTER had learned from UNCLE_VERNONthat people liked to be left alone while people did this, but it was very difficult, HARRY_POTTER'd never had so many questions in HARRY_POTTER life.
"ministry o' magic messin' things up as usual," me hagrid muttered, turning the page.
"there's a ministry of magic?"
HARRY_POTTER asked, before HARRY_POTTER could stop HARRY_POTTER.
"'course," said me hagrid.
"they wanTED dumbledore for minister, 0 ' course, but minister'd never leave hogwarts, so old CORNELIUS_FUDGE got the job.
bungler if ever there was one.
so minister pelts dumbledore's
with owls every morning, askin' for advice."
"but what does a ministry of magic magic do?"
"well, they main job is to keep it from the muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country."
"why?"
"why?
blimey, HARRY_POTTER, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to blimey, HARRY_POTTER problems.
nah, we're best left alone."
at this MOMent another boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.
me hagrid folded up me hagrid newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.
passersby stared a lot at me hagrid as passersby walked through the little town to the station.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't blame passersby.
not only was me hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, HARRY_POTTER kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, "see that, HARRY_POTTER?
things these muggles dream up, eh?"
"hagrid," said HARRY_POTTER, panting a bit as HARRY_POTTER ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at GRINGOTTS?"
"well, so they say," said me hagrid.
"crikey, i'd like a dragon."
"you'd like one?"
"wanTED one ever since i was a kid -- here we go."
they had reached the station.
there was a train to lonDON in five minutes' time.
hagrid, who didn't understand "muggle money," as he called it, gave the BILLs to HARRY_POTTER so he could buy they tickets.
people stared more than ever on a train to lonDON.
me hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.
"still got yer letter, HARRY_POTTER?"
HARRY_POTTER asked as HARRY_POTTER counTED stitches.
HARRY_POTTER took the parchment envelope out of HARRY_POTTER pocket.
"good," said me hagrid.
"there's a list there of everything YEH need."
HARRY_POTTER unfolded a second piece of paper HARRY_POTTER hadn't noticed the night before, and read:

    "can we buy all this in lonDON?"
HARRY_POTTER wondered aloud.
"if YEH know where to go," said me hagrid.
HARRY_POTTER had never been to lonDON before.
although me hagrid seemed to know where HARRY_POTTER was going, HARRY_POTTER was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.
HARRY_POTTER got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
"i DON't know how the muggles manage without magic," HARRY_POTTER said as the muggles climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.
me hagrid was so huge that me hagrid parTED the crowd easily; HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER had to do was keep close behind me hagrid.
the crowd passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if that could sell you a magic wand.
this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.
could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?
were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?
might this not all be some huge joke that the DURSLEYS had cooked up?
if HARRY_POTTER hadn't known that the DURSLEYS had no sense of humor, HARRY_POTTER might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything me hagrid had told HARRY_POTTER so far was unbelievable, HARRY_POTTER couldn't help trusting HARRY_POTTER.
"this is it," said me hagrid, coming to a halt, "the leaky cauldron.
it's a famous place."
it was a tiny, grubby-looking pub.
me hagrid me hagrid hadn't poinTED me hagrid out, HARRY_POTTER wouldn't have noticed me hagrid was there.
the people hurrying by didn't glance at me hagrid.
the people hurrying  eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if the people hurrying  couldn't see the leaky cauldron at all.
in fact, HARRY_POTTER had the most peculiar feeling that only HARRY_POTTER and me hagrid could see it.
before HARRY_POTTER could mention this, me hagrid had steered HARRY_POTTER inside.
for a famous place, it was very dark and shabby.
a few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.
one of a few old women  was smoking a long pipe.
a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.
the low buzz of chatter stopped when the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut walked in.
everyone seemed to know me hagrid; everyone waved and smiled at me hagrid, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "the usual, me hagrid?"
"can't, TOM, i'm on hogwarts business," said me hagrid, clapping TOM great hand on HARRY_POTTER's shoulder and making HARRY_POTTER's knees buckle.
"good lord," said the bartender, peering at HARRY_POTTER, "is this -- can this be --?"
the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
"bless my soul," whispered the bartender, "HARRY_POTTER... what an honor."
TOM hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward HARRY_POTTER and seized TOM hand, tears in TOM eyes.
"welcome back, "HARRY_POTTER..., welcome back."
HARRY_POTTER didn't know what to say.
everyone was looking at HARRY_POTTER.
the old woman with a long pipe was puffing on the old woman with the pipe without realizing the old woman with the pipe had gone out.
me hagrid was beaming.
then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next MOMent, HARRY_POTTER found HARRY_POTTER shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron.
"DORIS_CROCKFORD, mr. POTTER, can't believe i'm meeting you at last."
"so proud, "HARRY_POTTER..., i'm just so proud."
"always wanTED to shake your hand -- i'm all of a flutter."
"delighTED, mr. POTTER, just can't tell you, DIGGLE's the name, DEDALUS_DIGGLE."
"i've seen you before!"
said HARRY_POTTER, as DEDALUS_DIGGLE's top hat fell off in HARRY_POTTER excitement.
"you bowed to HARRY_POTTER once in a shop."
"HARRY_POTTER remembers!"
cried DEDALUS_DIGGLE's, looking around at everyone.
"did you hear that?
HARRY_POTTER remembers me!"
HARRY_POTTER shook hands again and again -- DORIS_CROCKFORD kept coming back for more.
a pale young man made a pale young man way forward, very nervously.
one of a pale young man was twitching.
"professor QUIRTELL!"
said me hagrid.
"HARRY_POTTER, professor QUIRTELLwill be one of your teachers at hogwarts."
"p-p-POTTER," stammered professor QUIRTELL, grasping HARRY_POTTER's hand, "c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased i am to meet you."
"what sort of magic do you teach, professor QUIRTELL?"
"d-defense against the d-d-dark arts," muttered professor QUIRTELL, as though professor QUIRTELL'd rather not think about it.
"n-not that you n-need it, eh, p-p-POTTER?"
professor QUIRTELL laughed nervously.
"you'll be g-getting all your equipment, i suppose?
i've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself."
professor QUIRTELL looked terrified at the very thought.
but the others wouldn't let professor QUIRTELL keep HARRY_POTTER to professor QUIRTELL.
it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all.
at last, me hagrid managed to make me hagrid heard over the babble.
"must get on -- lots ter buy.
come on, HARRY_POTTER."
DORIS_CROCKFORD shook HARRY_POTTER's hand one last time, and me hagridled them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
me hagrid grinned at HARRY_POTTER.
"told YEH, didn't i?
told YEH you was famous.
professor QUIRTELL was tremblin' ter meet YEH -- mind you, YEH's usually tremblin'."
"is YEH always that nervous?"
"oh, yeah.
poor bloke.
brilliant mind.
YEH was fine while YEH was
    studyin' outta books but then YEH took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....
they say YEH met vampires in the black forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.
scared of the students, scared of YEH own subject now, where's me umbrella?"
vampires?
hags?
HARRY_POTTER's head was swimming.
me hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
"three up... two across YEH muttered.
"right, stand back, HARRY_POTTER."
YEH tapped the wall above the trash can three times with the point of YEH umbrella.
the brick YEH had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisTED and turned out of sight.
"welcome," said me hagrid, "to DIAGON_ALLEY."
YEH grinned at HARRY_POTTER's amazement.
they stepped through the archway.
HARRY_POTTER looked quickly over HARRY_POTTER shoulder and saw the archwayshrink instantly back into solid wall.
the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
cauldrons -- all sizes - copper, brass, pewter, silver -- self-stirring -- collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.
"yeah, you'll be needin' one," said me hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money first."
HARRY_POTTER wished HARRY_POTTER had about eight more eyes.
HARRY_POTTER turned HARRY_POTTER head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside they, the people doing the people  shopping.
a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking a plump woman outside an apothecary as the people  passed, saying, "dragon liver, seventeen SICKLES an ounce, the people 're mad...."
    a low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium -- tawny, screech, barn, BROWN, and snowy.
several boys of about HARRY_POTTER's age had several boys of about HARRY_POTTER's age noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
"look," HARRY_POTTER heard one of several boys of about HARRY_POTTER's age say, "the new nimbus two thousand -- fastest ever --" there were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments HARRY_POTTER had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spLEE_JORDANns and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....
    "GRINGOTTS," said me hagrid.
they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops.
standing beside a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -
    "yeah, that's a goblin," said me hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward me hagrid.
a goblin was about a head shorter than HARRY_POTTER.
a goblin had a swarthy, clever face, a poinTED beard and, HARRY_POTTER noticed, very long fingers and feet.
a goblin bowed as they walked inside.
now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon they:
    enter, stranger, but take heed
    of what awaits the sin of greed,
    for those who take, but do not earn,
    must pay most dearly in what awaits the sin of greed,
    for those who take, but do not earn turn.
so if you seek beneath our floors
    a treasure that was never yours,
    thief, you have been warned, beware
    of finding more than treasure there.
"like i said, YEH'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said me hagrid.
a pair of goblins bowed a pair of goblins through its burnished bronze doors and a pair of goblinswere in a vast marble hall.
about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.
there were too many doors to count leading off a vast marble hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of more goblins.
hagrid and HARRY_POTTER made for a long counter.
"morning," said me hagrid to a free goblin.
"our've come ter take some money outta "HARRY_POTTER...'s safe."
"you have "HARRY_POTTER... key, "HARRY_POTTER...?"
"got it here somewhere," said me hagrid, and me hagrid starTED emptying me hagrid pockets onto a long counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over a free goblin's book of numbers.
a free goblin wrinkled a free goblin nose.
HARRY_POTTER watched a free goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.
"got it," said me hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
a free goblin looked at a free goblin closely.
"that seems to be in order."
"an' i've also got a letter here from professor dumbledore," said me hagrid importantly, throwing out me hagrid chest.
"it's about the youknow-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen."
the goblin read a letter here from professor dumbledore carefully.
"very well," me hagrid said, handing a letter here from professor dumbledore back to me hagrid, "i will have someone take you down to both vaults.
GRIPHOOK!"
GRIPHOOK was yet another goblin.
once me hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, hagrid and HARRY_POTTER followed "
    GRIPHOOK toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
"what's the YOU-KNOW-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen?"
HARRY_POTTER asked.
"can't tell YEH that," said me hagrid mysteriously.
"very secret.
hogwarts business.
professor dumbledore's trusTED me.
more'n my job's worth ter tell YEH that."
GRIPHOOK held the door open for hogwarts business.
HARRY_POTTER, who had expecTED more marble, was surprised.
HARRY_POTTER, who had expecTED more marble were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches.
it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. "
GRIPHOOK whistled and a small cart came hurtling up little railway tracks on the floor toward HARRY_POTTER, who had expecTED more marble.
HARRY_POTTER, who had expecTED more marble climbed in -- hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.
at first HARRY_POTTER, who had expecTED more marble just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.
HARRY_POTTER tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.
a small cart seemed to know a small cart own way, because "
    GRIPHOOK wasn't steering.
HARRY_POTTER's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but HARRY_POTTER kept them wide open.
once, HARRY_POTTER thought HARRY_POTTER saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisTED around to see if a burst of fire was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
i never know,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER called to me hagrid over the noise of a small cart, "what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"
"stalagmite's got an 'm' in stalagmite," said me hagrid.
"an' DON' ask me questions just now, i think i'm gonna be sick."
HARRY_POTTER did look very green, and when a small cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, me hagrid got out and had to lean against the passage wall to stop HARRY_POTTER knees from trembling.
    "
GRIPHOOK unlocked a small door in the passage wall.
a lot of green smoke came BILLowing out, and as a lot of green smoke cleared, HARRY_POTTER gasped.
inside were mounds of gold coins.
columns of silver.
heaps of little bronze KNUTS.
"all yours," smiled me hagrid.
HARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER's -- it was incredible.
the DURSLEYS couldn't have known about this or they'd have had the DURSLEYS from the DURSLEYS faster than blinking.
how often had they complained how much HARRY_POTTER cost they to keep?
and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to the DURSLEYS, buried deep under lonDON.
me hagrid helped HARRY_POTTER pile some of me hagrid into a bag.
"the gold ones are galleons," the DURSLEYS explained.
"seventeen silver SICKLES to a galleon and twenty-nine KNUTS to a sickle, it's easy enough.
right, that should be enough for a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for YEH."
YEH turned to "
    GRIPHOOK.
"vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?"
"one speed only," said "
    GRIPHOOK.
they were going even deeper now and gathering speed.
the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.
they went rattling over an underground ravine, and HARRY_POTTER leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark botTOM, but me hagridgroaned and pulled HARRY_POTTER back by the scruff of HARRY_POTTER neck.
vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
"stand back," said "
    GRIPHOOK importantly.
HARRY_POTTER stroked a small door in the passage wallgently with one of HARRY_POTTER long fingers and a small door in the passage wall simply melTED away.
"if anyone but a GRINGOTTS goblin tried that, anyone but a GRINGOTTS goblin'd be sucked through a small door in the passage wall and trapped in there," said "
    GRIPHOOK.
"how often do you check to see if anyone's inside?"
HARRY_POTTER asked.
"about once every ten years," said "
    GRIPHOOK with a rather nasty grin.
something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, HARRY_POTTER was sure, and HARRY_POTTER leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first HARRY_POTTER thought it was empty.
then HARRY_POTTER noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in BROWN paper lying on the floor.
me hagrid picked a grubby little package wrapped up in BROWN paper lying on the floor up and tucked a grubby little package wrapped up in BROWN paper lying on the floor deep inside me hagrid coat.
HARRY_POTTER longed to know what a grubby little package wrapped up in BROWN paper lying on the floor was, but knew better than to ask.
"come on, back in this infernal cart, and DON't talk to HARRY_POTTER on the way back, it's best if i keep me mouth shut," said me hagrid.
one wild cart ride later one wild cart stood blinking in the sunlight outside GRINGOTTS.
HARRY_POTTER didn't know where to run first now that HARRY_POTTERhad a bag full of money.
HARRY_POTTER didn't have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that HARRY_POTTER was holding more money than HARRY_POTTER'd had in HARRY_POTTER whole life -- more money than even dudley had ever had.
"might as well get yer uniform," said me hagrid, nodding toward MADAM_MALKIN's robes for all occasions.
"listen, HARRY_POTTER, would YEH mind if i slipped off for a pick-me-up in the leaky cauldron?
i hate i slipped off for a pick-me-up in the leaky cauldron GRINGOTTS carts."
HARRY_POTTER did still look a bit sick, so HARRY_POTTERentered MADAM_MALKIN's shop alone, feeling nervous.
MADAM_MALKIN was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
"hogwarts, clear?"
MADAM_MALKIN said, when HARRY_POTTER starTED to speak.
"got the lot here -- another young man being fitTED up just now, in fact. "
in the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, poinTED face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up a second witch long black robes.
MADAM_MALKIN stood HARRY_POTTER on a stool next to MADAM_MALKIN) slipped a long robe over MADAM_MALKIN head, and began to pin a long robe over his head to the right length.
"hello," said the boy, "hogwarts, too?"
"yes," said HARRY_POTTER.
"father's NEXT_DOOR buying my books and MOTHER's up the street looking at wands," said a boy with a pale, poinTED face.
a boy with a pale, poinTED face had a bored, drawling voice.
"then i'm going to drag a bored, drawling voice off to took at racing brooms.
i DON't see why first years can't have a bored, drawling voice own.
i think i'll bully father into getting me one and i'll smuggle it in somehow."
HARRY_POTTER was strongly reminded of dudley.
"have you got your own broom?"
a boy with a pale, poinTED face went on.
"no," said HARRY_POTTER.
"play quidditch at all?"
"no," HARRY_POTTER said again, wondering what on earth quidditch could be.
"i do -- father says it's a crime if i'm not picked to play for my house, and i must say, i agree.
know my house you'll be in yet?"
"no," said HARRY_POTTER, feeling more stupid by the minute.
"well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but i know i'll be in SLYTHERINS, all they family have been -- imagine being in HUFFLEPUFFS, i think i'd leave, wouldn't you?"
"mmm," said HARRY_POTTER, wishing HARRY_POTTER could say something a bit more interesting.
"i say, look at HARRY_POTTER!"
said a boy with a pale, poinTED face suddenly, nodding toward the front window.
me hagrid was standing there, grinning at HARRY_POTTER and pointing at two large ice creams to show me hagrid couldn't come in.
"that's hagrid," said HARRY_POTTER, pleased to know something a boy with a pale, poinTED facedidn't.
"me hagrid works at hogwarts."
"oh," said a boy with a pale, poinTED face, "i've heard of a boy with a pale, poinTED face.
a boy with a pale, poinTED face's a sort of servant, isn't a boy with a pale, poinTED face?"
"a boy with a pale, poinTED face's the gamekeeper," said HARRY_POTTER.
a boy with a pale, poinTED face was liking a boy with a pale, poinTED face less and less every second.
"yes, exactly.
i heard a boy with a pale, poinTED face's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then a boy with a pale, poinTED face gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to a boy with a pale, poinTED face bed."
"i think a boy with a pale, poinTED face's brilliant," said HARRY_POTTER coldly.
"do you?"
said a boy with a pale, poinTED face, with a slight sneer.
"why is a boy with a pale, poinTED face with you?
where are your parents?"
"your parents're dead," said HARRY_POTTER shortly.
a boy with a pale, poinTED face didn't feel much like going into the matter with a boy with a pale, poinTED face.
"oh, sorry," said the other,.
not sounding sorry at all.
"but your parents were our kind, weren't your parents?"
"your parents were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
"i really DON't think your parents should let the other sort in, do you?
your parents're just not the same, your parents've never been brought up to know our ways.
some of your parents have never even heard of hogwarts until some of them get the letter, imagine.
i think some of them should keep the letter in the old wizarding families.
what's your surname, anyway?"
but before HARRY_POTTER could answer, MADAM_MALKIN said, "that's you DONe, my dear," and HARRY_POTTER, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to a boy with a pale, poinTED face, hopped down from the footstool.
"well, i'll see you at hogwarts, i suppose," said a boy with a pale, poinTED face.
HARRY_POTTER was rather quiet as HARRY_POTTER ate the ice cream me hagrid had bought HARRY_POTTER (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
"what's up?"
said me hagrid.
"nothing,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER lied.
"nothing," HARRY_POTTER lied stopped to buy parchment and quills.
HARRY_POTTER cheered up a bit when HARRY_POTTER found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
when "nothing," HARRY_POTTER lied had left the shop, HARRY_POTTER said, "hagrid, what's quidditch?"
"blimey, HARRY_POTTER, i keep forgettin' how little YEH know -- not knowin' about quidditch!"
"DON't make me feel worse," said HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER told me hagrid about the pate boy in MADAM_MALKIN.
    "
--and --and said people from muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in."
"yer not from a muggle family.
if "yer not from a muggle family'd known who YEH were -- "yer not from a muggle family's grown up knowin' yer name if "yer not from a muggle family parents are wizardin' folk.
you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when everyone in the leaky cauldron saw YEH.
anyway, what does "yer not from a muggle family know about it, some o' the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in some o' in a long line 0' muggles -- look at yer mum!
look what muggles -- had for a sister!"
"so what is quidditch?"
"it's our sport.
wizard sport.
it's like -- like soccer in the muggle world -- everyone follows quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
"and what are SLYTHERINS and HUFFLEPUFFS?"
"school houses.
there's four.
everyone says HUFFLEPUFFS are a lot o' duffers, but --"
    "i bet i'm in HUFFLEPUFFS" said HARRY_POTTER gloomily.
"better HUFFLEPUFFS than SLYTHERINS," said me hagrid darkly.
"there's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in SLYTHERINS.
YOU-KNOW-who was one."
"vol-, sorry - YOU-KNOW-who was at hogwarts?"
"years an' years ago," said me hagrid.
they bought HARRY_POTTER's school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in postage stamps at all.
even dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.
me hagrid almost had to drag HARRY_POTTER away from curses and countercurses (bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges: hair loss, jelly-legs, tongue- tying and much, much more) by professor VINDICTUS_VIRIDIAN.
"i was trying to find out how to curse dudley."
"i'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances," said me hagrid.
"an' anyway, YEH couldn' work any of them curses yet, YEH'll need a lot more study before YEH get ter that level."
hagrid wouldn't let HARRY_POTTER buy a solid gold cauldron, either (". "
hagrid says pewter on yer list"), but "
    hagrid got a nice set of scales for weighing potion inGREDients and a collapsible brass telescope.
then "
    hagrid visiTED the apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotTED cabbages.
barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of FANGs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.
while me hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion inGREDients for HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five KNUTS a scoop).
outside the apothecary, me hagrid checked HARRY_POTTER's list again.
"just yer wand left - a yeah, an' i still haven't got YEH a birthday present."
HARRY_POTTER felt "
    HARRY_POTTER go red.
"you DON't have to --"
    "i know i DON't have to.
tell "
    HARRY_POTTER what, i'll get yer animal.
not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, YEH'd be laughed at - an' i DON' like cats, toads make me sneeze.
i'll get yer an owl.
all the kids want owls, all the kids're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'."
twenty minutes later, all the kids left eeylops owl emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes.
HARRY_POTTER now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asLEE_JORDANp with "
    HARRY_POTTER head under "
    HARRY_POTTER wing.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't stop stammering HARRY_POTTER thanks, sounding just like professor QUIRTELL.
"DON' mention it," said hagrid gruffly.
".
"DON' expect you've had a lotta presents from them DURSLEYS.
just OLLIVANDERs left now - only place for wands, OLLIVANDERs, and YEH gotta have the best wand."
a magic wand... this was what HARRY_POTTER had been really looking forward to.
the last shop was narrow and shabby.
peeling gold letters over the door read OLLIVANDERs: makers of fine wands since 382 b.c.
a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
a tinkling CHASER_KATIE_BELL rang somewhere in the depths of the last shop as a tinkling CHASER_KATIE_BELLstepped inside.
it was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that me hagrid sat on to wait.
HARRY_POTTER felt strangely as though HARRY_POTTER had entered a very strict library; HARRY_POTTER swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to HARRY_POTTER and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
for some reason, the back of HARRY_POTTER neck prickled.
the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
"good afternoon," said a soft voice.
HARRY_POTTER jumped.
me hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and me hagridgot quickly off the spindly chair.
an old man was standing before them, an old man wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the last shop.
"hello," said HARRY_POTTER awkwardly.
"ah yes," said an old man.
"yes, yes.
i thought i'd be seeing you soon.
HARRY_POTTER."
it wasn't a question.
"you have your MOTHER's eyes.
it seems only yesterday your MOTHER was in here your MOTHER, buying your MOTHER first wand.
ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.
nice wand for charm work."
mr. OLLIVANDER moved closer to HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER wished mr. OLLIVANDER would blink.
his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop were a bit creepy.
"your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.
eleven inches.
pliable.
a little more power and excellent for transfiguration.
well, i say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course."
mr. OLLIVANDER had come so close that mr. OLLIVANDER and HARRY_POTTER were almost nose to nose.
HARRY_POTTER could see HARRY_POTTER reflecTED in his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.
"and that's where...mr. OLLIVANDER touched the lightning scar on HARRY_POTTER's forehead with a long, white finger.
"i'm sorry to say i sold the wand that did it," HARRY_POTTER said softly.
"thirteen-and-a-half inches.
YEW.
powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if i'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do...."
    YEW shook YEW head and then, to HARRY_POTTER's relief, spotTED me hagrid.
"rubeus!
me hagrid!
how nice to see you again.... OAK, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
"it was, sir, yes," said me hagrid.
"good wand, that one.
but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?"
said mr. OLLIVANDER, suddenly stern.
"er -- yes, they did, yes," said me hagrid, shuffling me hagrid feet.
"i've still got the pieces, though," YEW added brightly.
"but you DON't use the pieces?"
said mr. OLLIVANDER sharply.
"oh, no, sit," said me hagrid quickly.
HARRY_POTTER noticed HARRY_POTTER gripped HARRY_POTTER pink umbrella very tightly as HARRY_POTTER spoke.
"hmmm," said mr. OLLIVANDER, giving me hagrid a piercing look.
"well, now -- mr. POTTER.
let me see."
HARRY_POTTER pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of HARRY_POTTER pocket.
"which is your wand arm?"
"er -- well, i'm right-handed," said HARRY_POTTER.
"hold out your wand arm.
that's it."
HARRY_POTTER measured HARRY_POTTER from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.
as HARRY_POTTER measured, HARRY_POTTER said, "every OLLIVANDER wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, mr. POTTER.
we use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons.
no two OLLIVANDER wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.
and of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand."
HARRY_POTTER suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between HARRY_POTTER nostrils, was doing this on "
    HARRY_POTTER own.
mr. OLLIVANDER was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
"that will do," mr. OLLIVANDER said, and a long tape measure.
"right then, mr. POTTER.
try a long tape measure.
BEECHWOOD and dragon heartstring.
nine inches.
nice and flexible.
just take it and give it a wave."
HARRY_POTTER took that wand and (feeling foolish) waved that wand around a bit, but mr. OLLIVANDER snatched that wand out of mr. OLLIVANDER hand almost at once.
"maple and phoenix feather.
seven inches.
quite whippy.
try --"
    HARRY_POTTER tried -- but "
    HARRY_POTTER had hardly raised that wand when that wand, too, was snatched back by mr. OLLIVANDER.
"no, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
go on, go on, try it out."
HARRY_POTTER tried.
and tried. "
HARRY_POTTER had no idea what mr. OLLIVANDER was waiting for.
the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands mr. OLLIVANDER pulled from the shelves, the happier mr. OLLIVANDER seemed to become.
"tricky cusTOMer, eh?
not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- i wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
HARRY_POTTER took that wand.
mr. OLLIVANDER felt a sudden warmth in mr. OLLIVANDER fingers.
mr. OLLIVANDER raised that wand above mr. OLLIVANDER head, brought that wand swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
hagrid whooped and clapped and mr. OLLIVANDER cried, "oh, bravo!
yes, indeed, oh, very good.
well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "
    he put HARRY_POTTER's wand back into HARRY_POTTER's wand box and wrapped its box in BROWN paper, still muttering, "curious... curious..
    "sorry," said HARRY_POTTER, "but what's curious?"
mr. OLLIVANDER fixed HARRY_POTTER with mr. OLLIVANDER pale stare.
"i remember every wand i've ever sold, mr. POTTER.
every single wand.
it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other.
it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for HARRY_POTTER's wand when HARRY_POTTER's wand brother why, HARRY_POTTER's wand brother gave you that scar."
HARRY_POTTER swallowed.
"yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches.
YEW.
curious indeed how these things happen.
HARRY_POTTER's wand chooses the wizard, remember....
i think we must expect great things from you, HARRY_POTTER.... after all, he- who-must-not-be-named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."
HARRY_POTTER shivered.
YEW wasn't sure YEW liked mr. OLLIVANDER too much.
YEW paid seven gold galleons for YEW , and mr. OLLIVANDERbowed seven gold galleons from mr. OLLIVANDER shop.
the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as HARRY_POTTER and hagrid made HARRY_POTTER and hagrid  way back down DIAGON_ALLEY, back through the wall, back through the leaky cauldron, now empty.
HARRY_POTTER didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; HARRY_POTTER didn't even notice how much people were gawking at people  on the underground, laden as people  were with all people  funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asLEE_JORDANp in all  cage on HARRY_POTTER's lap.
up another escalator, out into paddington station; "
    HARRY_POTTERonly realized where people  were when hagrid  tapped "
    HARRY_POTTER on the shoulder.
"got time for a bite to eat before yer train leaves," "
    HARRY_POTTER said.
    "
HARRY_POTTER bought HARRY_POTTER a hamburger and people  sat down on plastic seats to eat people .
HARRY_POTTER kept looking around.
everything looked so strange, somehow.
"you all right, HARRY_POTTER?
yer very quiet," said hagrid .
HARRY_POTTER wasn't sure HARRY_POTTER could explain.
HARRY_POTTER'd just had the best birthday of HARRY_POTTER life -- and yet -- HARRY_POTTER chewed a hamburger, trying to find the words.
"everyone thinks i'm special," HARRY_POTTER said at last.
"all those people in the leaky cauldron, professor QUIRTELL, mr. OLLIVANDER... but i DON't know anything about magic at all.
how can they expect great things?
i'm famous and i can't even remember what i'm famous for.
i DON't know what happened when vol-, sorry -- i mean, the night my parents died.hagrid  leaned across the table.
behind the wild beard and eyebrows HARRY_POTTER wore a very kind smile.
"DON' you worry, HARRY_POTTER.
you'll learn fast enough.
everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts, you'll be just fine.
just be yerself.
i know it's hard.
YEH've been singled out, an' that's always hard.
but YEH've have a great time at hogwarts -- i did -- still do, 'smatter of fact.hagrid  helped HARRY_POTTER on to the train that would take HARRY_POTTER back to DURSLEYS, then handed HARRY_POTTER an envelope.
"yer ticket for hogwarts, " HARRY_POTTER said.
"first o' september -- king's cross -- it's all on yer ticket.
any problems with DURSLEYS, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... see YEH soon, HARRY_POTTER."
the train that would take him back to the DURSLEYS pulled out of the station.
HARRY_POTTER wanTED to watch hagrid  until HARRY_POTTER was out of sight; HARRY_POTTER rose in HARRY_POTTER seat and pressed HARRY_POTTER nose against the window, but HARRY_POTTER blinked and hagrid  had gone.
chapter six.
the journey from platform nine and three-quarters.
HARRY_POTTER's last month with DURSLEYS wasn't fun.
true, dudley was now so scared of HARRY_POTTER dudley wouldn't stay in the same room, while AUNT_PETUNIA and UNCLE_VERNON didn't shut HARRY_POTTER in dudley cupboard, force dudley to do anything, or shout at dudley -- in fact, they didn't speak to dudley at all.
half terrified, half furious, they acTED as though any chair with HARRY_POTTER in it were empty.
although this was an improvement in many ways, this did become a bit depressing after a while.
HARRY_POTTER kept to the same room, with HARRY_POTTER new owl for company.
HARRY_POTTER had decided to call her HEDWIG, a name HARRY_POTTER had found in a history of magic.
HARRY_POTTER school books were very interesting.
HARRY_POTTER lay on HARRY_POTTER bed reading late into the night, HEDWIG swooping in and out of the open window as HEDWIG pleased.
it was lucky that AUNT_PETUNIA didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because HEDWIG kept bringing back dead mice.
every night before HARRY_POTTER went to sLEE_JORDANp, HARRY_POTTER ticked off another day on the piece of paper HARRY_POTTER had pinned to the wall, counting down to september the first.
on the last day of august HARRY_POTTER thought HARRY_POTTER'd better speak to HARRY_POTTER aunt and uncle about getting to king's cross station the next day, so HARRY_POTTER went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
HARRY_POTTER cleared HARRY_POTTER throat to let they know HARRY_POTTER was there, and dudley screamed and ran from the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
"er -- UNCLE_VERNON?"
UNCLE_VERNON grunTED to show UNCLE_VERNON was listening.
"er -- i need to be at king's cross TOMorrow to -- to go to hogwarts."
UNCLE_VERNON grunTED again.
"would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"
grunt.
HARRY_POTTER supposed that meant yes.
"thank you."
HARRY_POTTER was about to go back upstairs when UNCLE_VERNON actually spoke.
"funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train.
magic carpets all got punctures, have magic carpets all?"
HARRY_POTTER didn't say anything.
"where is this school, anyway?"
"i DON't know," said HARRY_POTTER, realizing this for the first time.
HARRY_POTTER pulled hagrid  had GIVEN_HARRY out of his pocket.
"i just take the train that would take him back to the DURSLEYS from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock," HARRY_POTTER read.
HARRY_POTTER aunt and uncle stared.
"platform what?"
"nine and three-quarters."
"DON't talk rubbish," said UNCLE_VERNON.
"there is no platform nine and three-quarters."
"it's on my ticket."
"barking," said UNCLE_VERNON, "howling mad, the lot of them.
you'll see.
you just wait.
all right, we'll take you toking's crossking's cross.
we're going up to lonDON TOMorrow anyway, or i wouldn't bother."
"why are you going to lonDON?"
HARRY_POTTER asked, trying to keep things friendly.
"taking dudley to the hospital," growled UNCLE_VERNON.
"got to have that ruddy tail removed before UNCLE_VERNON goes to SMELTINGS."
HARRY_POTTER woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too exciTED and nervous to go back to sLEE_JORDANp. "
HARRY_POTTER got up and pulled on "
    HARRY_POTTER jeans because "
    HARRY_POTTER didn't want to walk into the station in "
    HARRY_POTTER wizard's robes -- "
    HARRY_POTTER'd change on the train that would take him back to the DURSLEYS. "
HARRY_POTTER checked "
    HARRY_POTTER hogwarts list yet again to make sure "
    HARRY_POTTER had everything "
    HARRY_POTTER needed, saw that HEDWIG was shut safely in HEDWIG cage, and then paced the room, waiting for DURSLEYS to get up.
two hours later, HARRY_POTTER's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into DURSLEYS car, AUNT_PETUNIA had talked dudleyinto sitting next to HARRY_POTTER, and they had set off.
they reached king's cross at half past ten.
UNCLE_VERNONdumped HARRY_POTTER's trunk onto a cart and wheeled a cart into the stationfor UNCLE_VERNON.
HARRY_POTTER thought this was strangely kind until UNCLE_VERNONstopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on HARRY_POTTER face.
"well, there you are, boy.
platform nine -- platform ten.
your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but your platform DON't seem to have built your platform yet, do your platform?"
he was quite right, of course.
there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.
"have a good term," said UNCLE_VERNON with an even nastier smile.
UNCLE_VERNON left without another word.
HARRY_POTTER turned and saw DURSLEYS drive away.
all three of them were laughing.
HARRY_POTTER's mouth went rather dry.
what on earth was UNCLE_VERNON going to do?
UNCLE_VERNON was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of HEDWIG.
UNCLE_VERNON'd have to ask someone.
UNCLE_VERNON stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.
a passing guard had never heard of hogwarts and when HARRY_POTTER couldn't even tell UNCLE_VERNON what part of the country it was in, UNCLE_VERNON starTED to get annoyed, as though HARRY_POTTER was being stupid on purpose.
getting desperate, HARRY_POTTER asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but a passing guard said there wasn't one.
in the end a passing guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.
HARRY_POTTER was now trying hard not to panic.
according to the large clock over the arrivals board, HARRY_POTTER had ten minutes left to get on the train that would take him back to the DURSLEYS to hogwarts and HARRY_POTTER had no idea how to do it; HARRY_POTTER was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk HARRY_POTTER could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
hagrid  must have forgotten to tell HARRY_POTTER something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into DIAGON_ALLEY.
HARRY_POTTER wondered if HARRY_POTTER should get out HARRY_POTTER's wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
at that MOMent a group of people passed just behind HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER caught a few words of what a group of people were saying.
    "
-- packed with muggles, of course --"
    HARRY_POTTER swung round.
the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.
each of a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair was pushing a trunk like HARRY_POTTER's in front of HARRY_POTTER -- and a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair had an owl.
heart hammering, HARRY_POTTER pushed HARRY_POTTER cart after a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.
a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair stopped and so did HARRY_POTTER, just near enough to hear what a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair were saying.
"now, what's the platform number?"
said the boys' MOTHER.
"nine and three-quarters!"
piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding the boys' MOTHER hand, "MOM, can't i go... "
    "you're not old enough, the boys' MOTHER, now be quiet.
all right, PERCY_WEASLEY, you go first."
what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
HARRY_POTTER watched, careful not to blink in case HARRY_POTTER missed case -- but just as the oldest boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of HARRY_POTTER and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the oldest boyhad vanished.
"FRED_WEASLEY, you next," the plump woman said.
"i'm not FRED_WEASLEY, i'm GEORGE_WEASLEY," said the oldest boy.
"honestly, woman, you call honestly, woman our MOTHER?
cara you tell i'm GEORGE_WEASLEY?"
"sorry, GEORGE_WEASLEY, dear."
"only joking, i am FRED_WEASLEY," said the oldest boy, and off the oldest boy went.
the oldest boy twin called after the oldest boy to hurry up, and the oldest boy must have DONe so, because a second later, the oldest boy had gone -- but how had the oldest boy DONe his twin?
now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier the third brother was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, the third brother wasn't anywhere.
there was nothing else for his twin.
"excuse me," HARRY_POTTER said to the plump woman.
"hello, dear," the plump woman said.
"first time at hogwarts?
ron's new, too."
the plump woman poinTED at the last and youngest of the plump woman sons.
the third brother was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
"yes," said HARRY_POTTER.
"the thing is -- the thing is, i DON't know how to --"
    "how to get onto the platform?"
the plump woman said kindly, and "
    HARRY_POTTERnodded.
"not to worry," the plump woman said.
"all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
DON't stop and DON't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important.
best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
go on, go now before ron."
"er -- okay," said HARRY_POTTER.
ron pushed ron trolley around and stared at the barrier .
it looked very solid.
ron starTED to walk toward it.
people jostled ron on people way to platforms nine and ten.
HARRY_POTTER walked more quickly.
ron was going to smash right into the barrier  and then ron'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on ron cart, ron broke into a heavy run -- the barrier  was coming nearer and nearer -- ron wouldn't be able to stop -- his cart was out of control -- ron was a foot away -- ron closed ron eyes ready for the crash --
    it didn't come... ron kept on running... ron opened his eyes.
a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
a sign overhead said hogwarts express, eleven o'clock. "
HARRY_POTTERlooked behind HARRY_POTTER and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words platform nine and three-quarters on the barrier , "
    HARRY_POTTER had DONe the barrier .
smoke from the engine drifTED over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between the chattering crowd legs.
owls hooTED to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.
the first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to the first few carriages families, some fighting over seats.
HARRY_POTTER pushed his cart off down a platform packed with people in search of an empty seat.
HARRY_POTTER passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "GRAN, i've lost my toad again."
"oh, MR._LONGBOTTOM," HARRY_POTTER heard the old woman sigh.
a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
"give us a look, LEE_JORDAN, go on."
a boy with dreadlocks lifTED the lid of a box in a boy with dreadlocks arms, and the people around a boy with dreadlocks shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
HARRY_POTTER pressed on through a small crowd until HARRY_POTTER found an empty compartment near the end of the train.
HARRY_POTTER put HEDWIG inside first and then starTED to shove and heave HARRY_POTTER trunk toward the traindoor.
HARRY_POTTER tried to lift his trunk up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice HARRY_POTTER dropped his trunk painfully on HARRY_POTTER foot.
"want a hand?"
it was one of the red-haired twins HARRY_POTTER'd followed through the barrier .
"yes, please," HARRY_POTTER panTED.
"oy, FRED_WEASLEY!
c'mere and help!"
with the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier help, HARRY_POTTER's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of an empty compartment.
"thanks," said HARRY_POTTER, pushing HARRY_POTTER sweaty hair out of his eyes.
"what's that?"
said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at HARRY_POTTER's lightning scar.
"blimey," said the other twin.
"are you
    "he is," said the first twin.
"aren't you?"
he added to HARRY_POTTER.
"what?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"HARRY_POTTER, "chorused the twins.
"oh, HARRY_POTTER," said HARRY_POTTER.
"i mean, yes, i am."
the two boys gawked at HARRY_POTTER, and HARRY_POTTER felt HARRY_POTTER turning red.
then, to HARRY_POTTER relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.
"FRED_WEASLEY?
GEORGE_WEASLEY?
are you there?"
"coming, MOM."
with a last look at HARRY_POTTER, the twins hopped off the train.
HARRY_POTTER sat down next to the window where, half hidden, HARRY_POTTER could watch the red-haired family on a platform packed with people and hear what the twins were saying.
the twins MOTHER had just taken out their MOTHER handkerchief.
"ron, you've got something on your nose."
the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but the youngest boy grabbed the youngest boy and began rubbing the end of the youngest boy nose.
"MOM -- geroff" the youngest boy wriggled free.
"aaah, has ickle RONNIE got somefink on the youngest boy nosie?"
said one of the twins.
"shut up," said ron.
"where's PERCY_WEASLEY?"
said their MOTHER.
"the youngest boy's coming now."
the youngest boy came striding into sight.
the youngest boy had already changed into the youngest boy BILLowing black hogwarts robes, and HARRY_POTTER noticed a shiny silver badge on the youngest boy chest with the letter p on it.
"can't stay long, their MOTHER," the youngest boy said.
"i'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to the prefects  --"
    "oh, are you a prefect, PERCY_WEASLEY?"
said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise.
"you should have said something, we had no idea."
"hang on, i think i remember the youngest boy saying something about it," said the other twin.
"once --"
    "or twice --"
    "a minute --"
    "all summer --"
    "oh, shut up," said PERCY_WEASLEY.
"how come PERCY_WEASLEY gets his BILLowing black hogwarts robes, anyway?"
said one of the twins.
"because PERCY_WEASLEY's a prefect," said their MOTHER fondly.
"all right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there."
she kissed PERCY_WEASLEY on the cheek and PERCY_WEASLEY left.
then she turned to the twins.
"now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves.
if i get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"
    "blown up a toilet?
we've never blown up a toilet."
"great idea though, thanks, MOM."
"it's not funny.
and look after ron."
"DON't worry, ickle RONNIEkins is safe with we."
"shut up," said ron again.
ron was almost as tall as the twins already and ron nose was still pink where their MOTHER had rubbed his nose.
"hey, MOM, guess what?
guess who we just met on the train?"
HARRY_POTTER leaned back quickly so they couldn't see HARRY_POTTER looking.
"you know that black-haired boy who was near we in the station?
know who black-haired boy who was near us in the station is?"
"who?"
"HARRY_POTTER!"
HARRY_POTTER heard the little girl's voice.
"oh, MOM, can i go on the train and see black-haired boy who was near us in the station, MOM, eh please...."
    "you've already seen black-haired boy who was near us in the station, the boys' MOTHER, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.
is the poor boy really, FRED_WEASLEY?
how do you know?"
"asked the poor boy.
saw the poor boy scar.
it's really there - like lightning."
"poor dear - no wonder he was alone, i wondered.
he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto a platform packed with people."
"never mind that, do you think he remembers what YOU-KNOW-who looks like?"
their MOTHER suddenly became very stern.
"i forbid you to ask he, FRED_WEASLEY.
no, DON't you dare.
as though he needs reminding of that on he first day at school."
"all right, keep your hair on."
a whistle sounded.
"hurry up!"
their MOTHER said, and the three boys clambered onto the train.
their leaned out of the window for their MOTHER to kiss their good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.
"DON't, the boys' MOTHER, we'll send you loads of owls."
"we'll send you a hogwarts toilet seat."
"GEORGE_WEASLEY!"
"only joking, MOM."
the train began to move.
HARRY_POTTER saw the three boys waving and their younger sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until the train gathered too much speed, then their MOTHER fell back and waved.
HARRY_POTTER watched the girl and their MOTHER MOTHER disappear as the train rounded the corner.
houses flashed past the window.
HARRY_POTTER felt a great leap of excitement.
HARRY_POTTER didn't know what HARRY_POTTER was going to but it had to be better than what HARRY_POTTER was leaving behind.
the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.
"anyone sitting there?"
the youngest redheaded boy asked, pointing at a hogwarts toilet seat opposite HARRY_POTTER.
"everywhere else is full."
HARRY_POTTER shook "
    HARRY_POTTER head and the youngest redheaded boy sat down. "
HARRY_POTTER glanced at "
    HARRY_POTTERand then looked quickly out of the window, pretending "
    HARRY_POTTER hadn't looked.
HARRY_POTTER saw HARRY_POTTER still had a black mark on HARRY_POTTER nose.
"hey, ron."
the twins were back.
"listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- LEE_JORDAN's got a giant tarantula down there."
"right," mumbled ron.
    "
HARRY_POTTER," said the other twin, "did we introduce we?
FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY.
and this is ron, we brother.
see you later, then.
"bye," said HARRY_POTTER and ron. "
the twins slid the door of the compartmentshut behind "
    the twins.
"are you really HARRY_POTTER?"
ron blurTED out.
HARRY_POTTER nodded.
"oh -well, i thought it might be one of FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY's jokes," said ron.
"and have you really got -- you know..."
    ron poinTED at HARRY_POTTER's forehead.
HARRY_POTTER pulled back HARRY_POTTER bangs to show the lightning scar.
ronstared.
"so that's where YOU-KNOW-who
    "yes," said HARRY_POTTER, "but i can't remember it."
"nothing?"
said ron eagerly.
"well -- i remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."
"wow," said ron.
ron sat and stared at HARRY_POTTER for a few MOMents, then, as though ron had suddenly realized what ron was doing, ron looked quickly out of the window again.
"are all your family wizards?"
asked HARRY_POTTER, who found ron just as interesting as ron found ron.
"er -- yes, i think so," said ron.
"i think MOM's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about a second cousin who's an accountant."
"so you must know loads of magic already."
the MRS._WEASLEY were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in DIAGON_ALLEY had talked about.
"i heard you went to live with muggles," said ron.
"what are they like?"
"horrible -well, not all of they.
my aunt and uncle and cousin are, though.
wish i'd had three wizard brothers."
"five," said ron.
for some reason, ron was looking gloomy.
"i'm the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts.
you could say i've got a lot to live up to.
BILL and charlie have already left -- BILLwas head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch.
now PERCY_WEASLEY's a prefect.
FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY mess around a lot, but FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY still get really good marks and everyone thinks FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY're really funny.
everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if i do, it's no big deal, because everyone  did no big deal first.
you never get anything new, either, with three wizard brothers.
i've got BILL's old robes, charlie's old wand, and PERCY_WEASLEY's old rat."
ron reached inside "
    ron jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asLEE_JORDANp.
". "
ron name's SCABBERS and "
    ron's useless, "
    ron hardly ever wakes up.
PERCY_WEASLEY got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- i mean, i got SCABBERS instead."
ron's ears went pink.
PERCY_WEASLEY seemed to think PERCY_WEASLEY'd said too much, because PERCY_WEASLEY went back to staring out of the window.
HARRY_POTTER didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.
after all, HARRY_POTTER'd never had any money in HARRY_POTTER life until a month ago, and HARRY_POTTER told ron so, all about having to wear dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
this seemed to cheer ron up.
"... and until hagrid told me, i didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or VOLDEMORT"
    ron gasped.
"what?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"you said YOU-KNOW-who's name!"
said ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.
"i'd have thought you, of all people --"
    "i'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said HARRY_POTTER, i just never knew you shouldn't.
see what i mean?
i've got loads to learn....
i bet," HARRY_POTTER added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying HARRY_POTTER a lot lately, "i bet i'm the worst in the class."
"you won't be.
there's loads of people who come from muggle families and loads of people who come from muggle families learn quick enough."
while loads of people who come from muggle families had been talking, the train had carried loads of people who come from muggle families out of lonDON.
now loads of people who come from muggle families were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.
loads of people who come from muggle families were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back a smiling, dimpled woman door and said, "anything off the cart, dears?"
HARRY_POTTER, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but ron's ears went pink again and ron muttered that ron'd brought sandwiches.
HARRY_POTTER went out into the corridor.
HARRY_POTTER had never had any money for candy with the DURSLEYS, and now that HARRY_POTTER had pockets rattling with gold and silver HARRY_POTTER was ready to buy as many mars bars as HARRY_POTTER could carry -- but the woman didn't have mars bars.
what the woman did have were BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans, drooble's best blowing gum, chocolate frogs.
pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, licorice wands, and a number of other strange things HARRY_POTTER had never seen in HARRY_POTTER life.
not wanting to miss anything, HARRY_POTTER got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver SICKLES and seven bronze KNUTS.
ron stared as HARRY_POTTER brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped the compartment  onto an empty seat.
"hungry, are you?"
"starving," said HARRY_POTTER, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped a lumpy package.
there were four sandwiches inside.
ron pulled one of four sandwiches apart and said, "she always forgets i DON't like corned beef."
"swap you for one of these," said HARRY_POTTER, holding up a pasty.
"go on --"
    "you DON't want this, it's all dry," said ron.
"she hasn't got much time," ron added quickly, "you know, with five of us."
"go on, have a pasty," said HARRY_POTTER, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
it was a nice feeling, sitting there with ron, eating their way through all HARRY_POTTER's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
"what are these?"
HARRY_POTTER asked ron, holding up a pack of chocolate frogs.
"they're not really frogs, are they?"
HARRY_POTTER was starting to feel that nothing would surprise HARRY_POTTER.
"no," said ron.
"but see what the card is.
i'm missing AGRIPPA."
"what?"
"oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- chocolate frogs have cards, inside chocolate frogs, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards.
i've got about five hundred, but i haven't got AGRIPPA."
HARRY_POTTER unwrapped HARRY_POTTER chocolate frog and picked up the card.
it showed a man's face.
HARRY_POTTER wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache.
underneath the picture was dumbledore.
"so this is dumbledore!"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"DON't tell me you'd never heard of dumbledore!"
said ron.
"can i have a frog?
i might get AGRIPPA -- thanks
    HARRY_POTTER turned over the card and read:
    ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE
    currently headmaster of hogwarts
    considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, dumbledore is particularly famous for dumbledore defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and dumbledore work on alchemy with dumbledore partner, MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel.
dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
HARRY_POTTER turned the card back over and saw, to HARRY_POTTER astonishment, that dumbledore's face had disappeared.
"HARRY_POTTER's gone!"
"well, you can't expect HARRY_POTTER to hang around all day," said ron.
"HARRY_POTTER'll be back.
no, i've got MORGANA again and i've got about six of MORGANA... do you want it?
you can start collecting."
ron's eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped.
"help yourself," said HARRY_POTTER.
"but in, you know, the muggle world, people just stay put in photos."
"do the muggle world, people?
what, the muggle world, people DON't move at all?"
ron sounded amazed.
"weird!"
HARRY_POTTER stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on "
    HARRY_POTTER card and gave "
    HARRY_POTTER a small smile.
ron was more interesTED in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards, but HARRY_POTTER couldn't keep "
    ron's eyes off the famous witches and wizards cards.
soon HARRY_POTTER had not only dumbledore and MORGANA, but HENGIST of WOODcroft, ALBERIC_GRUNNION, circe, paracelsus, and MERLIN.
HARRY_POTTER finally tore "
    ron's eyes away from the druidess CLIODNA, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans.
"you want to be careful with those," ron warned HARRY_POTTER.
"when they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe.
GEORGE_WEASLEY reckons GEORGE_WEASLEY  had a booger- flavored one once."
ron picked up a green bean, looked at a green bean carefully, and bit into a corner.
"bleaaargh -- see?
sprouts."
sprouts had a good time eating the every flavor beans.
HARRY_POTTERgot toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.
the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.
the neat fields had gone.
now there were WOODs, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.
there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in.
the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER looked tearful.
"sorry," the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"
when they shook they heads, the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER wailed, "i've lost the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER!
the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER keeps getting away from the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER!"
"the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER'll turn up," said HARRY_POTTER.
"yes," said the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER miserably.
"well, if you see the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER..."
    the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER left.
"DON't know why the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER's so bothered," said ron.
"if i'd brought a toad i'd lose a toad as quick as i could.
mind you, i brought SCABBERS, so i can't talk."
the rat was still snoozing on ron's lap.
"the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said ron in disgust.
"i tried to turn the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER yellow yesterday to make the round-faced boy HARRY_POTTER more interesting, but the spell didn't work.
i'll show you, look..."
    he rummaged around in he trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand.
a very battered-looking wand was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.
"unicorn hair's nearly poking out.
anyway
    unicorn had just raised unicorn when the compartment door slid open again.
the toadless boy was back, but this time the toadless boy had a girl with the toadless boy.
a girl  was already wearing a girl  new hogwarts robes.
"has anyone seen a toad?
MR._LONGBOTTOM's lost one," a girl  said.
a girl  had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy BROWN hair, and rather large front teeth.
"we've already told unicorn we haven't seen it," said ron, but a girl  wasn't listening, a girl  was looking at a very battered-looking wand in unicorn hand.
"oh, are you doing magic?
let's see it, then."
a girl  sat down.
ron looked taken aback.
"er -- all right."
ron cleared ron throat.
"sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."
ron waved a very battered-looking wand, but nothing happened.
SCABBERS stayed gray and fast asLEE_JORDANp.
"are you sure that's a real spell?"
said a girl .
"well, it's not very good, is it?
i've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for ron.
nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter, but i was ever so pleased, of course, i mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, i've heard -- i've learned all our course books by heart, of course, i just hope it will be enough -- i'm HERMIONE_GRANGER, by the way, who are you.
she said all this very fast.
HARRY_POTTER looked at ron, and was relieved to see by HARRY_POTTER stunned face that HARRY_POTTER hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.
"i'm MR._RON,MR._RON muttered.
"HARRY_POTTER," said HARRY_POTTER.
"are you really?"
said HERMLONE.
"i know all about you, of course -- i got a few extra books.
for background reading, and you're in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century.
"am i?"
said HARRY_POTTER, feeling dazed.
"goodness, didn't you know, i'd have found out everything i could if it was me," said HERMLONE.
"do either of you know what house you'll be in?
i've been asking around, and i hope i'm in GRYFFINDOR, it sounds by far the best; i hear dumbledore was in it, but i suppose RAVENCLAW wouldn't be too bad....
anyway, we'd better go and look for MR._LONGBOTTOM's toad.
you two had better change, you know, i expect we'll be there soon."
and she left, taking the toadless boy with she.
"whatever house i'm in, i hope she's not in whatever house," said ron.
ron threw a very battered-looking wand back into his trunk.
"stupid spell -- GEORGE_WEASLEY gave it to me, bet GEORGE_WEASLEY knew it was a dud."
"whatever house are your brothers in?"
asked HARRY_POTTER.
"GRYFFINDOR," said ron.
gloom seemed to be settling on ron again.
"MOM and dad were in it, too.
i DON't know what MOM and dad'll say if i'm not.
i DON't suppose RAVENCLAW would be too bad, but imagine if MOM and dad put me in SLYTHERINS."
"that's the house vol-, i mean, YOU-KNOW-who was in?"
"yeah," said ron.
ron flopped back into ron seat, looking depressed.
"you know, i think the ends of SCABBERS' whiskers are a bit lighter," said HARRY_POTTER, trying to take ron's mind off houses.
"so what do your brothers do now that your brothers've left, anyway?"
HARRY_POTTER was wondering what a wizard did once "
    HARRY_POTTER'd finished school.
"charlie's in romania studying dragons, and BILL's in africa doing something for GRINGOTTS," said ron.
"did you hear about
    GRINGOTTS?
it's been all over the daily PROPHET, but i DON't suppose you get that with the muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault."
HARRY_POTTER stared.
"really?
what happened to them?"
"nothing, that's why it's such big news.
them haven't been caught.
my dad says it must've been a powerful dark wizard to get round GRINGOTTS, but them DON't think them took anything, that's what's odd.
'course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case YOU-KNOW-who's behind this ."
HARRY_POTTER turned this news over in HARRY_POTTER mind.
HARRY_POTTER was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you- KNOW-WHO was mentioned.
KNOW-WHO supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but this had been a lot more comfortable saying "VOLDEMORT" without worrying.
"what's your quidditch team?"
ron asked.
"er -- i DON't know any,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER confessed.
"what!"
ron looked dumbfounded.
"oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --" and ron was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games ron'd been to with ron brothers and the broomstick ron'd like to get if ron had the money.
ron was just taking HARRY_POTTER through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but the compartment door wasn't MR._LONGBOTTOM the toadless boy, or HERMIONE_GRANGER this time.
three boys entered, and HARRY_POTTER recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop.
the pale boy from MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop was looking at HARRY_POTTER with a lot more interest than the pale boy from MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop'd shown back in DIAGON_ALLEY.
"is it true?"
the pale boy from MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop said.
"they're saying all down the train that HARRY_POTTER's in this compartment.
so it's you, is it?"
"yes," said HARRY_POTTER.
the pale boy from MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop was looking at three boys.
both of three boys were thickset and looked extremely mean.
standing on either side of the pale boy from MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop, three boys looked like bodyguards.
"oh, this is CRABBE and this is GOYLE," said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where HARRY_POTTER was looking.
"and my name's MALFOY, DRACO_MALFOY."
ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget.
DRACO_MALFOY looked at DRACO_MALFOY.
"think my name's funny, do you?
no need to ask who you are.
DRACO_MALFOY told me all the MRS._WEASLEY have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford."
DRACO_MALFOY turned back to HARRY_POTTER.
"you'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, HARRY_POTTER.
you DON't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
i can help you there."
DRACO_MALFOY held out DRACO_MALFOY hand to shake HARRY_POTTER's, but HARRY_POTTER didn't take his hand.
"i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for DRACO_MALFOY, thanks," HARRY_POTTER said coolly.
DRACO_MALFOY didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in DRACO_MALFOY pale cheeks.
"i'd be careful if i were you, HARRY_POTTER," DRACO_MALFOY said slowly.
"unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents.
your parents didn't know what was good for your parents, either.
you hang around with riffraff like the MRS._WEASLEY and that hagrid, and hagrid'll rub off on you."
both HARRY_POTTER and ron stood up.
"say that again," ron said, ron face as red as ron hair.
"oh, you're going to fight us, are you?"
DRACO_MALFOY sneered.
"unless you get out now," said HARRY_POTTER, more bravely than HARRY_POTTER felt, because CRABBE and GOYLE were a lot bigger than CRABBE or ron.
"but us DON't feet like leaving, do us, boys?
us've eaten all us food and you still seem to have some."
GOYLE reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ronleapt forward, but before ron'd so much as touched GOYLE, GOYLE let out a horrible yell.
SCABBERS the rat was hanging off ron finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into GOYLE's knuckle - CRABBE and MALFOY backed away as GOYLE swung SCABBERS round and round, howling, and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once.
perhaps them thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps them'd heard footsteps, because a second later, HERMIONE_GRANGER had come in.
"what has been going on?"
she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up SCABBERS by ron tail.
i think ron's been knocked out," ron said to HARRY_POTTER.
ron looked closer at SCABBERS.
"no -- i DON't believe it -- ron's gone back to sLEE_JORDANp-"
    and so ron had.
"you've met DRACO_MALFOY before?"
HARRY_POTTER explained about them meeting in DIAGON_ALLEY.
"i've heard of ron family," said ron darkly.
"them were some of the first to come back to them side after YOU-KNOW-who disappeared.
said them'd been bewitched.
my dad doesn't believe it.
my dad says DRACO_MALFOY's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the dark side."
my dad turned to HERMLONE.
"can them help you with something?"
"you'd better hurry up and put your robes on, i've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and my dad says them're nearly there.
you haven't been fighting, have you?
you'll be in trouble before them even get there!"
"SCABBERS has been fighting, not them," said ron, scowling at SCABBERS.
"would you mind leaving while them change?"
"all right -- i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said HERMLONE in a sniffy voice.
"and you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?"
ron glared at SCABBERS as SCABBERS left.
HARRY_POTTER peered out of the window.
it was getting dark.
HARRY_POTTER could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky.
the train did seem to be slowing down.
HARRY_POTTER and ron took off he and ron jackets and pulled on he and ron .
ron's were a bit short for ron, you could see ron sneakers underneath he and ron.
a voice echoed through the train: "we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes' time.
please leave your luggage on the train, the train will be taken to the school separately."
HARRY_POTTER's sTOMach lurched with nerves and ron, ron saw, looked pale under ron freckles.
they crammed they pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
the train slowed right down and finally stopped.
people pushed people way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.
HARRY_POTTER shivered in the cold night air.
then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and HARRY_POTTER heard a familiar voice: "firs' years!
firs' years over here!
all right there, HARRY_POTTER?"
hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
"c'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years?
mind yer step, now!
firs' years follow me!"
slipping and stumbling, they followed "
    hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.
it was so dark on either side of they that HARRY_POTTER thought there must be thick trees there.
nobody spoke much.
MR._LONGBOTTOM, the boy who kept losing MR._LONGBOTTOM toad, sniffed once or twice.
"ye' all get yer firs' sight o' hogwarts in a sec," hagrid called over hagrid  shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."
there was a loud "oooooh!"
the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.
perched atop a high mountain on the other side, a high mountain on the other side windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
"no more'n four to a boat!"
"
    hagrid called, pointing to a fLEE_JORDANt of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.
HARRY_POTTER and ronwere followed into HARRY_POTTER and ron  boat by MR._LONGBOTTOM and HERMLONE.
"everyone in?"
shouTED hagrid, who had a boat to himself.
"right then -- forward!"
and the fLEE_JORDANt of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass.
everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead.
it towered over everyone as everyone sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
"heads down!"
yelled "
    hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff on which it stood; they all bent they all heads and the little boats carried their heads through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.
their heads were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking their heads right underneath the great castle overhead, until their heads reached a kind of underground harbor, where their heads clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
"oy, you there!
is this your toad?"
said hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of people.
"TREVOR!"
cried MR._LONGBOTTOM blissfully, holding out MR._LONGBOTTOM hands.
then their heads clambered up a passageway in the rock after "
    hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the great castle overhead.
their heads walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, OAK front door.
"everyone here?
you there, still got yer toad?"
hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.
chapter seven.
the sorting hat.
the castle door swung open at once.
a tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.
a tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes had a very stern face and HARRY_POTTER's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.
"the firs' years, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL," said "
    hagrid.
"thank you, "
    hagrid.
i will take a tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes from here."
a tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes pulled the castle door wide.
the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the DURSLEYS' house in the entrance hall.
the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at GRINGOTTS, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing the stone walls led to the upper floors.
the stone walls followed professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL across the flagged stone floor.
HARRY_POTTER could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the entrance hall.
the stone walls crowded in, standing rather closer together than the stone walls would usually have DONe, peering about nervously.
"welcome to hogwarts," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"the start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the entrance hall, you will be sorTED into your houses.
the sorting is the sorting ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within hogwarts.
you will have classes with the rest of your house, sLEE_JORDANp in your housedormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.
"your houses are called GRYFFINDOR, HUFFLEPUFFS, RAVENCLAW, and SLYTHERINS.
each house has each house own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.
while you are at hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points.
at the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor.
i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes you.
"the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.
i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."
her eyes lingered for a MOMent on MR._LONGBOTTOM's clOAK, which was fastened under MR._LONGBOTTOM left ear, and on ron's smudged nose.
HARRY_POTTERnervously tried to flatten HARRY_POTTER hair.
"i shall return when we are ready for you," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"please wait quietly."
HARRY_POTTER left the chamber.
HARRY_POTTER swallowed.
"how exactly do they sort we into houses?"
HARRY_POTTER asked ron.
"some sort of test, i think.
FRED_WEASLEY said it hurts a lot, but i think FRED_WEASLEY was joking."
HARRY_POTTER's heart gave a horrible jolt.
a test?
in front of the school?
but FRED_WEASLEY didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would FRED_WEASLEY have to do?
FRED_WEASLEY hadn't expecTED something like this the MOMent they arrived.
FRED_WEASLEY looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.
no one was talking much except HERMIONE_GRANGER, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need.
HARRY_POTTER tried hard not to listen to she.
HARRY_POTTER'd never been more nervous, never, not even when HARRY_POTTER'd had to take a school report home to the DURSLEYS saying that HARRY_POTTER'd somehow turned HARRY_POTTER teacher's wig blue.
HARRY_POTTER kept HARRY_POTTER eyes fixed on the castle door.
any second now, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL would come back and lead professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL doom.
then something happened that made professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL screamed.
"what the --?"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL gasped.
so did the people around professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall.
pearly-white and slightly transparent, about twenty ghosts  glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.
about twenty ghosts  seemed to be arguing.
what looked like a fat little monk was saying: "forgive and forget, i say, about twenty ghosts  ought to give a fat little monk a second chance --"
    "my dear friar, haven't about twenty ghosts  given peeves all the chances my dear friar deserves?
my dear friar gives us all a bad name and you know, my dear friar's not really even a ghost -- i say, what are you all doing here?"
a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
nobody answered.
"new students!"
said my dear friar, smiling around at new students.
"about to be sorTED, i suppose?"
a few people nodded mutely.
"hope to see you in HUFFLEPUFFS!"
said my dear friar.
"my old house, you know."
"move along now," said a sharp voice.
"the sorting ceremony about to start."
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had returned.
one by one, about twenty ghosts floaTED away through the back wall.
"now, form a line," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL told the first years, "and follow me."
feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, HARRY_POTTER got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with ronhis, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the entrance hall.
HARRY_POTTER had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.
it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.
four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.
at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL led the first years up here, so that the teachers came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind the teachers.
the hundreds of faces staring at the teachers looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.
dotTED here and there among the students, about twenty ghosts  shone misty silver.
mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, HARRY_POTTER looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotTED with stars.
HARRY_POTTER heard
    HERMLONE whisper, "its bewitched to look like the sky outside.
i read about its in hogwarts, a history."
it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the entrance hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.
HARRY_POTTER quickly looked down again as professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.
on top of the stool she put a poinTED wizard's hat.
a poinTED wizard's hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.
AUNT_PETUNIA wouldn't have let a poinTED wizard's hat in the house.
maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of a rabbit, HARRY_POTTER thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at a poinTED wizard's hat, HARRY_POTTER stared at it, too.
for a few seconds, there was complete silence.
then a poinTED wizard's hat twitched.
a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and a poinTED wizard's hat began to sing:
    "oh, you may not think i'm pretty,
    but DON't judge on what you see,
    i'll eat HARRY_POTTER if you can find
    a smarter hat than HARRY_POTTER.
you can keep your bowlers black,
    your top hats sLEE_JORDANk and tall,
    for i'm the hogwarts sorting hat
    and i can cap your top hats.
there's nothing hidden in your head
    a poinTED wizard's hat can't see,
    so try me on and i will tell you
    where you ought to be.
you might belong in GRYFFINDOR,
    where dwell the brave at heart,
    their daring, nerve, and chivalry set GRYFFINDORs apart;
    you might belong in HUFFLEPUFFS,
    where their are just and loyal,
    those patient HUFFLEPUFFS are true and unafraid of toil;
    or yet in wise old RAVENCLAW,
    if you've a ready mind,
    where those of wit and learning,
    will always find those of wit and learning kind;
    or perhaps in SLYTHERINS
    you'll make your real friends,
    those cunning folk use any means
    to achieve those cunning folk ends.
so put me on!
DON't be afraid!
and DON't get in a flap!
you're in safe hands (though i have none)
    for i'm a thinking cap!"
the whole hall burst into applause as a poinTED wizard's hat finished a poinTED wizard's hat song.
the whole hall bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
"so we've just got to try on a poinTED wizard's hat!"
ron whispered toHARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER.
"i'll kill FRED_WEASLEY, FRED_WEASLEY was going on about wrestling a troll.HARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER.
smiled weakly.
yes, trying on a poinTED wizard's hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but FRED_WEASLEY did wish they could have tried a poinTED wizard's hat on without everyone watching.
a poinTED wizard's hat seemed to be asking rather alot; HARRY_POTTER didn't feel brave or quick-witTED or any of a poinTED wizard's hat at the MOMent.
if only a poinTED wizard's hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
"when i call your name, you will put on a poinTED wizard's hat and sit on the stool to be sorTED," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL said.
"ABBOTT, HANNAH!"
a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over "
    a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails eyes, and sat down.
a MOMents pause --
    "HUFFLEPUFFS!"
shouTED a poinTED wizard's hat.
the table on the right cheered and clapped as HANNAH went to sit down at the HUFFLEPUFFS table.
HARRY_POTTER saw the ghost of my dear friar waving merrily at "
    a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails.
"bones, SUSAN!"
"HUFFLEPUFFS!"
shouTED a poinTED wizard's hat again, and SUSAN scuttled off to sit next to HANNAH.
"boot, TERRY!"
"RAVENCLAW!"
the table second from the left clapped this time; several RAVENCLAWs stood up to shake hands with TERRY as TERRY joined several RAVENCLAWs.
    "
BROCKLEHURST, MANDY" went to RAVENCLAW too, but "BROWN, lavender" became the first new GRYFFINDOR, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; HARRY_POTTER could see ron's twin brothers catcalling.
"bulstrode, MILLICENT" then became a SLYTHERINS.
perhaps it was HARRY_POTTER's imagination, after all HARRY_POTTER'd heard about SLYTHERINS, but HARRY_POTTER thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
HARRY_POTTER was starting to feel definitely sick now.
HARRY_POTTER remembered being picked for teams during gym at HARRY_POTTER old school.
HARRY_POTTER had always been last to be chosen, not because HARRY_POTTER was no good, but because no one wanTED dudley to think they liked HARRY_POTTER.
"finch-fletchley, JUSTIN!"
"HUFFLEPUFFS!"
sometimes, HARRY_POTTER noticed, a poinTED wizard's hat shouTED out the house at once, but at others the house took a little while to decide.
"SEAMUS_FINNIGAN, SEAMUS_FINNIGAN," the sandy-haired boy next to HARRY_POTTER in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before a poinTED wizard's hat declared him a GRYFFINDOR.
"GRANger, HERMLONE!"
HERMLONE almost ran to the stool  and jammed a poinTED wizard's hat eagerly on "
    HERMLONE head.
"GRYFFINDOR!"
shouTED a poinTED wizard's hat.
ron groaned.
a horrible thought struck HARRY_POTTER, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous.
what if HARRY_POTTER wasn't chosen at all?
what if HARRY_POTTER just sat there with the hat over HARRY_POTTER eyes for ages, until professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL jerked it off her head and said there had obviously been a mistake and professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL'd better get back on the train?
when MR._LONGBOTTOM, the boy who kept losing professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL toad, was called, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL fell over on professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL way to the stool .
a poinTED wizard's hat took a long time to decide with MR._LONGBOTTOM.
when a poinTED wizard's hat finally shouTED, "GRYFFINDOR," MR._LONGBOTTOM ran off still wearing a poinTED wizard's hat, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give a poinTED wizard's hat to "macdougal, morag."
MALFOY swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: a poinTED wizard's hat had barely touched his when a poinTED wizard's hat screamed, "SLYTHERINS!"
MALFOY went to join "
    MALFOY friends CRABBE and GOYLE, looking pleased with "
    MALFOY.
there weren't many people left now.
"moon" "nott" "parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "PATIL" and "PATIL" then "perks, SALLY-ANNE" and then, at last -- "POTTER, HARRY_POTTER!"
as HARRY_POTTER stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
"POTTER, did "POTTER say?"
"POTTER?"
the last thing HARRY_POTTER saw before a poinTED wizard's hat dropped over HARRY_POTTER eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at HARRY_POTTER.
next second HARRY_POTTER was looking at the black inside of a poinTED wizard's hat.
HARRY_POTTER waiTED.
hmm," said a small voice in HARRY_POTTER ear.
"difficult.
very difficult.
plenty of courage, i see.
not a bad mind either.
there's talent, a my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....
so where shall i put you?HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER gripped the edges of the stool  and thought, not SLYTHERINS, not SLYTHERINS.
"not SLYTHERINS, eh?"
said the small voice.
"are you sure?
you could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and SLYTHERINS will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no?
well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER heard a poinTED wizard's hat shout the last word to the whole hall.
HARRY_POTTER took off a poinTED wizard's hat and walked shakily toward the GRYFFINDOR table.
HARRY_POTTER was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in SLYTHERINS , HARRY_POTTER hardly noticed that HARRY_POTTER was getting the loudest cheer yet.
PERCY_WEASLEY the prefect got up and shook the prefect hand vigorously, while the weasley twins yelled, "the weasley twins got "POTTER!
the weasley twins got "POTTER!"
HARRY_POTTER sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff HARRY_POTTER'd seen earlier.
the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier patTED the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier arm, giving HARRY_POTTER the sudden, horrible feeling the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier'd just plunged his arm into a bucket of ice-cold water.
the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier could see the high table properly now.
at the end nearest the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier sat hagrid, who caught the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier eye and gave the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier the thumbs up.
HARRY_POTTERgrinned back.
and there, in the center of the high table, in a large gold chair, sat ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
HARRY_POTTER recognized ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE at once from the card HARRY_POTTER'd gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
HARRY_POTTER spotTED professor QUIRTELL, too, the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron.
HARRY_POTTER was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
and now there were only three people left to be sorTED.
"THOMAS, DEAN_THOMAS," a black boy even taller than ron, joined HARRY_POTTER at the GRYFFINDOR table.
"TURPIN, LISA," became a RAVENCLAW and then it was ron's turn.
HARRY_POTTER was pale green by now.
HARRY_POTTER crossed HARRY_POTTER fingers under the table and a second later a poinTED wizard's hat had shouTED, "GRYFFINDOR!HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into a large gold chair next to HARRY_POTTER.
"well DONe, ron, excellent," said PERCY_WEASLEY pompously across HARRY_POTTER as "zabini, BLAISE," was made a SLYTHERINS.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL rolled up professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL scroll and took a poinTED wizard's hat away.
HARRY_POTTER looked down at HARRY_POTTER empty gold plate.
HARRY_POTTER had only just realized how hungry HARRY_POTTER was.
the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE had gotten to ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE feet.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was beaming at the students, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE more than to see them all there.
"welcome," ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE said.
"welcome to a new year at hogwarts!
before we begin we banquet, i would like to say a few words.
and here they are: nitwit!
blubber!
oddment!
tweak!
"thank you!"
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE sat back down.
everybody clapped and cheered.
HARRY_POTTER didn't know whether to laugh or not.
"is HARRY_POTTER -- a bit mad?"
HARRY_POTTER asked PERCY_WEASLEY uncertainly.
"mad?"
said PERCY_WEASLEY airily.
"HARRY_POTTER's a genius!
best wizard in the world!
but HARRY_POTTER is a bit mad, yes.
potatoes, HARRY_POTTER?HARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER's mouth fell open.
the dishes in front of HARRY_POTTER were now piled with food.
HARRY_POTTER had never seen so many things HARRY_POTTER liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
the DURSLEYS had never exactly starved HARRY_POTTER, but HARRY_POTTER'd never been allowed to eat as much as HARRY_POTTER liked.
dudley had always taken anything that HARRY_POTTER really wanTED, even if it made HARRY_POTTER sick.
HARRY_POTTERpiled HARRY_POTTER plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
it was all delicious.
"that does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching HARRY_POTTER cut up HARRY_POTTER steak,
    "can't you --?"
i haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost in the ruff sadly.
"i DON't need to, of course, but one does miss it.
i DON't think i've in troduced myself?
sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON at your service.
resident ghost of GRYFFINDOR tower."
"i know who you are!"
said ron suddenly.
"my brothers told me about you -- you're nearly HEADLESS_NICK!"
"i would prefer you to call me sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired SEAMUS_FINNIGAN interrupTED.
"nearly headless?
how can you be nearly headless?"
sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way "
    sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON wanTED.
"like this," "
    sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON said irritably. "
sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON seized "
    sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON left ear and pulled. "
sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON whole head swung off "
    sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON neck and fell onto "
    sir NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON shoulder as if his shoulder  was on a hinge.
someone had obviously tried to behead someone, but not DONe it properly.
looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, nearly HEADLESS_NICK flipped nearly HEADLESS_NICK back onto nearly HEADLESS_NICK, coughed, and said, "so -- new GRYFFINDORs!
i hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year?
GRYFFINDORs have never gone so long without winning.
SLYTHERINS have got the cup six years in a row!
the bloody BARON's becoming almost unbearable -- the bloody BARON's's the SLYTHERINS ghost.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER looked over at the SLYTHERINS table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
HARRY_POTTER was right next to MALFOY who, HARRY_POTTER was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
"how did HARRY_POTTER get covered in blood?"
asked SEAMUS_FINNIGAN with great interest.
"i've never asked," said nearly HEADLESS_NICK delicately.
when everyone had eaten as much as everyone could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving the food sparkling clean as before.
a MOMent later the desserts appeared.
blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jell-o, rice pudding -- "
    as HARRY_POTTER helped HARRY_POTTER to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
"i'm half-and-half," said SEAMUS_FINNIGAN.
"me dad's a muggle.
MOM didn't tell me dad's a muggle MOM  was a witch 'til after MOM  were married.
bit of a nasty shock for me dad's a muggle."
the others laughed.
"what about you, MR._LONGBOTTOM?"
said ron.
"well, GRAN brought me up and MOM 's a witch," said MR._LONGBOTTOM, "but the family thought i was all- muggle for ages.
my great uncle ALGIE kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of my great uncle ALGIE -- my great uncle ALGIE pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once, i nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until i was eight.
great uncle ALGIE came round for dinner, and my great uncle ALGIE was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie ENID offered my great uncle ALGIE a meringue and my great uncle ALGIE accidentally let go.
but i bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road.
they were all really pleased, GRAN was crying, GRAN was so happy.
and you should have seen they faces when i got in here -- they thought i might not be magic enough to come, you see.
great uncle ALGIE  great uncle ALGIE  was so pleased great uncle ALGIE  bought me my toad."
on HARRY_POTTER's other side, PERCY_WEASLEY and HERMLONE were talking about lessons ("i do hope PERCY_WEASLEY and HERMLONE start right away, there's so much to learn, i'm particularly interesTED in transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "you'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").
HARRY_POTTER, who was starting to feel warm and sLEE_JORDANpy, looked up at
    the high table again.
hagrid was drinking deeply from hagrid goblet.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was talking to ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, in ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
it happened very suddenly.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE looked past QUIRTELL's turban straight into HARRY_POTTER's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on HARRY_POTTER's forehead.
"ouch!"
HARRY_POTTER clapped a hand to HARRY_POTTER head.
"what is it?"
asked PERCY_WEASLEY.
"n-nothing."
the pain had gone as quickly as the pain had come.
harder to shake off was the feeling HARRY_POTTER had gotten from ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's look -- a feeling that HARRY_POTTER didn't like HARRY_POTTER at all.
"who's that teacher talking to ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE?"
he asked PERCY_WEASLEY.
"oh, you know ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE already, do you?
no wonder HARRY_POTTER's looking so nervous, that's professor SNAPE.
HARRY_POTTER teaches potions, but HARRY_POTTER doesn't want to -- everyone knows HARRY_POTTER's after ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's job.
knows an awful lot about the dark arts, professor SNAPE.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER watched professor SNAPE for a while, but professor SNAPE didn't look at professor SNAPE again.
at last, the desserts too disappeared, and ALBUS_DUMBLEDOREgot to his feet again.
the hall fell silent.
"AHERN -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered.
i have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils.
and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."
dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins.
"i have also been asked by mr. FILCH, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
anyone interesTED in playing for their house teams should contact MADAM_HOOCH.
"and finally, i must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER laughed, but HARRY_POTTER was one of the few who did.
"HARRY_POTTER's not serious?"
HARRY_POTTER muttered to PERCY_WEASLEY.
"must be," said PERCY_WEASLEY, frowning at ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"it's odd, because HARRY_POTTER usually gives us a reason why us're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that.
i do think HARRY_POTTER might have told us prefects, at least."
"and now, before us go to bed, let us sing the school song!"
cried ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
HARRY_POTTER noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE gave ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE wand a little flick, as if ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisTED a long golden ribbon, snakelike, into words.
"everyone pick everyone favorite tune," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, "and off we go!"
and school  CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed:
    "hogwarts, hogwarts, hoggy warty hogwarts,
    teach us something please,
    whether us be old and bald
    or young with scabby knees,
    us heads could do with filling
    with some interesting stuff,
    for now our heads're bare and full of air,
    dead flies and bits of fluff,
    so teach us things worth knowing,
    bring back what us've forgot,
    just do your best, us'll do the rest,
    and learn until us brains all rot.
everybody finished the school song at different times.
at last, only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE conducTED the weasley twins last few lines with ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE wand and when the weasley twins had finished, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was one of those who clapped loudest.
"ah, music," ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE said, wiping ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE eyes.
"a magic beyond all we do here!
and now, bedtime.
off you trot!"
the GRYFFINDOR first years followed PERCY_WEASLEY through the chattering crowds, out of the great hall, and up the marble staircase.
HARRY_POTTER's legs were like lead again, but only because PERCY_WEASLEY was so tired and full of food.
PERCY_WEASLEY was too sLEE_JORDANpy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and poinTED as the people in the portraits along the corridors passed, or that PERCY_WEASLEY PERCY_WEASLEY led the people in the portraits along the corridors through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries.
the people in the portraits along the corridors climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging the people in the portraits along the corridors feet, and HARRY_POTTER was just wondering how much farther the people in the portraits along the corridors had to go when the people in the portraits along the corridors came to a sudden halt.
a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of the people in the portraits along the corridors, and as PERCY_WEASLEY took a step toward the people in the portraits along the corridors the people in the portraits along the corridors starTED throwing the people in the portraits along the corridors at PERCY_WEASLEY.
"peeves,PERCY_WEASLEY PERCY_WEASLEY whispered to the first years.
"a poltergeist."
PERCY_WEASLEY raised PERCY_WEASLEY voice, "peeves -- show yourself"
    a loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
"do you want me to go to the bloody BARON?"
there was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.
"oooooooh!"
he said, with an evil cackle.
"ickle firsties!
what fun!"
he swooped suddenly at them.
them ducked.
"go away, peeves, or the BARON'll hear about this, i mean this!"
barked PERCY_WEASLEY.
peeves stuck out peeves tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on MR._LONGBOTTOM's head.
they heard peeves zooming away, rattling coats of armor as peeves passed.
"you want to watch out for peeves," said PERCY_WEASLEY, as they set off again.
"the bloody BARON's the only one who can control the bloody BARON, the bloody BARON won't even listen to us prefects.
here us are."
at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.
"password?"
she said.
"caput draconis," said PERCY_WEASLEY, and a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.
they all scrambled through a round hole in the wall -- MR._LONGBOTTOM needed a leg up -- and found they in the GRYFFINDOR common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
PERCY_WEASLEY direcTED the girls through one door to the girls dormitory and the boys through another.
at the top of a spiral staircase -- the girls were obviously in one of the towers -- the girls found the girls beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains.
the girls trunks had already been brought up.
too tired to talk much, their trunks pulled on their trunks pajamas and fell into bed.
    "
great food, isn't it?"
ron muttered to HARRY_POTTER through the hangings.
"get off, SCABBERS!
ron's chewing my sheets."
HARRY_POTTER was going to ask ron if ron'd had any of the treacle tart, but ron fell asLEE_JORDANp almost at once.
perhaps HARRY_POTTER had eaten a bit too much, because HARRY_POTTER had a very strange dream.
HARRY_POTTER was wearing professor QUIRTELL's turban, which kept talking to HARRY_POTTER, telling HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER must transfer to SLYTHERINS at once, because it was HARRY_POTTER destiny.
HARRY_POTTER told QUIRTELL's turban HARRY_POTTER didn't want to be in SLYTHERINS; it got heavier and heavier; HARRY_POTTER tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was MALFOY, laughing at HARRY_POTTER as HARRY_POTTER struggled with it -then MALFOY turned into the hook-nosed teacher, SNAPE, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and HARRY_POTTER woke, sweating and shaking.
HARRY_POTTER rolled over and fell asLEE_JORDANp again, and when HARRY_POTTER woke next day, HARRY_POTTER didn't remember the dream at all.
chapter eight.
the potions master.
there, look."
"where?"
"next to the tall kid with the red hair."
"wearing the glasses?"
"did you see HARRY_POTTER face?"
"did you see HARRY_POTTER scar?"
whispers followed HARRY_POTTER from the MOMent HARRY_POTTER left HARRY_POTTER dormitory the next day.
people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at HARRY_POTTER, or doubled back to pass HARRY_POTTER in the corridors again, staring.
HARRY_POTTER wished people lining up outside classrooms wouldn't, because HARRY_POTTER was trying to concentrate on finding HARRY_POTTER way to classes.
there were a hundred and forty-two staircases at hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.
then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled some that led somewhere different on a friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.
it was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.
the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and HARRY_POTTER was sure the coats of armor could walk.
the ghosts didn't help, either.
it was always a nasty shock when one of the ghosts glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.
nearly HEADLESS_NICK was always happy to point new GRYFFINDORs in the right direction, but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met nearly HEADLESS_NICK when you were late for class.
nearly HEADLESS_NICK would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, "got your conk!"
even worse than peeves the poltergeist, if that was possible, was the caretaker, argus FILCH.
HARRY_POTTER and ron managed to get on the wrong side of nearly HEADLESS_NICK on HARRY_POTTER and ron very first morning.
argus FILCH found HARRY_POTTER and ron trying to force HARRY_POTTER and ron way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.
argus FILCH wouldn't believe HARRY_POTTER and ron were lost, was sure HARRY_POTTER and ron were trying to break into they  on purpose, and was threatening to lock HARRY_POTTER and ron in the dungeons when HARRY_POTTER and ron were rescued by professor QUIRTELL, who was passing.
argus FILCH owned a cat called mrs. NORRIS, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like argus FILCH's.
she patrolled the corridors alone.
break a rule in front of she, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for FILCH, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later.
argus FILCH knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.
the students all haTED argus FILCH, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs. NORRIS a good kick.
and then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes them.
there was a lot more to magic, as HARRY_POTTER quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
they had to study the night skies through they telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.
three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology, with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
easily the most boring class was history of magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.
professor BINNS had been very old
    indeed when professor BINNS had fallen asLEE_JORDANp in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving professor BINNS body behind professor BINNS.
professor BINNS droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed up.
professor FLITWICK, the charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.
at the start of their first class his took the roll call, and when his reached HARRY_POTTER's name his gave an exciTED squeak and toppled out of sight.
professor BINNS was again different.
HARRY_POTTER had been quite right to think professor BINNS wasn't a teacher to cross.
strict and clever, professor BINNS gave them a talking-to the MOMent them sat down in professor BINNS first class.
"transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts," professor BINNS said.
"anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
you have been warned."
then professor BINNS changed his desk into a pig and back again.
they were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get starTED, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
after taking a lot of complicaTED notes, they were each given a match and starTED trying to turn a match into a needle.
by the end of the lesson, only HERMIONE_GRANGER had made any difference to only HERMIONE_GRANGER match; professor BINNS showed the class how professor BINNS had gone all silver and pointy and gave HERMLONE a rare smile.
the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts, but QUIRTELL's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
only HERMIONE_GRANGER classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire only HERMIONE_GRANGER'd met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get only HERMIONE_GRANGER one of these days.
only HERMIONE_GRANGER turban, only HERMIONE_GRANGER told his turban, had been given to only HERMIONE_GRANGER by an african prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but his turban weren't sure his turban believed this story.
for one thing, when SEAMUS_FINNIGAN asked eagerly to hear how QUIRTELL had fought off the zombie, QUIRTELL went pink and starTED talking about the weather; for another, his turban had noticed that a funny smell hung around his turban, and the weasley twins insisTED that QUIRTELL was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that QUIRTELL was protecTED wherever QUIRTELL went.
HARRY_POTTER was very relieved to find out that HARRY_POTTER wasn't miles behind everyone else.
lots of people had come from muggle families and, like HARRY_POTTER, hadn't had any idea that lots of people were witches and wizards.
there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn't have much of a head start.
friday was an important day for HARRY_POTTER and ron.
HARRY_POTTER and ron finally managed to find HARRY_POTTER and ron way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
"what have we got today?"
HARRY_POTTER asked ron as ron poured sugar on ron porridge.
"double potions with the SLYTHERINS," said ron.
"SNAPE's head of SLYTHERINS house.
they say SNAPE's head of SLYTHERINS house always favors they -- they'll be able to see if it's true."
"professor BINNS favored they, " said HARRY_POTTER.
professor BINNSwas head of GRYFFINDOR house, but professor BINNS hadn't stopped professor BINNS from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
just then, the mail arrived.
HARRY_POTTER had gotten used to this by now, but the mail had GIVEN_HARRY a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hallduring breakfast, circling the tables until about a hundred owls saw about a hundred owls owners, and dropping letters and packages onto about a hundred owls laps.
HEDWIG hadn't brought HARRY_POTTER anything so far.
HEDWIG sometimes flew in to nibble HARRY_POTTER ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sLEE_JORDANp in the owlery with the other school owls.
this morning, however, HEDWIG fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto HARRY_POTTER's plate.
HARRY_POTTER tore HARRY_POTTER's plate open at once.
HARRY_POTTER's plate said, in a very untidy scrawl:
    dear HARRY_POTTER,
    i know you get friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
i want to hear all about your first week.
send us an answer back with HEDWIG.
HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER borrowed ron's quill, scribbled yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent HEDWIG off again.
it was lucky that HARRY_POTTER had tea with hagrid to look forward to, because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to HARRY_POTTER so far.
at the start-of-term banquet, HARRY_POTTER had gotten the idea that professor SNAPE disliked HARRY_POTTER.
by the end of the first potions lesson, HARRY_POTTER knew HARRY_POTTER'd been wrong.
professor SNAPE didn't dislike HARRY_POTTER -- professor SNAPE haTED HARRY_POTTER.
potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons.
it was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
professor SNAPE, like FLITWICK, starTED my class by taking the roll call, and like FLITWICK, professor SNAPE paused at HARRY_POTTER's name.
"ah, yes," professor SNAPE said softly, "HARRY_POTTER.
our new -- celebrity."
DRACO_MALFOY and DRACO_MALFOY friends CRABBE and GOYLE sniggered behind their hands.
professor SNAPE finished calling the names and looked up at my class.
professor SNAPE eyes were black like hagrid
    , but they had none of hagrid's warmth.
they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking," professor SNAPE began.
professor SNAPE spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, professor SNAPE had y caught every word -- like professor BINNS, professor SNAPE had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
"as there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic.
i DON't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses....
i can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach."
more silence followed this little speech.
HARRY_POTTER and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.
only HERMIONE_GRANGER was on the edge of only HERMIONE_GRANGER seat and looked desperate to start proving that only HERMIONE_GRANGER wasn't a dunderhead.
"POTTER!"
said professor SNAPE suddenly.
"what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormWOOD?"
powdered root of what to an infusion of what?
HARRY_POTTER glanced at ron, who looked as stumped as HARRY_POTTER was; HERMLONE's hand had shot into the air.
"i DON't know, sit," said HARRY_POTTER.
professor SNAPE's lips curled into a sneer.
"tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything."
tut ignored HERMLONE's hand.
"let's try again.
"HARRY_POTTER, where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar?"
HERMLONE stretched HERMLONE hand as high into the air as it would go without HERMLONE leaving her seat, but HARRY_POTTER didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
HARRY_POTTER tried not to look at MALFOY, CRABBE, and GOYLE, who were shaking with laughter.
"i DON't know, sit."
"thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, "HARRY_POTTER?"
HARRY_POTTER forced HARRY_POTTER to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.
HARRY_POTTER had looked through HARRY_POTTER books at the DURSLEYS', but did professor SNAPE expect professor SNAPE to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi?
professor SNAPE was still ignoring HERMLONE's quivering hand.
"what is the difference, "HARRY_POTTER, between monkshood and wolfsBANE?"
at this, HERMLONE stood up, HERMLONE's quivering hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.
"i DON't know," said HARRY_POTTER quietly.
"i think HERMLONE does, though, why DON't you try HERMLONE?"
a few people laughed; HARRY_POTTER caught SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's eye, and SEAMUS_FINNIGAN winked.
professor SNAPE, however, was not pleased.
"sit down," SEAMUS_FINNIGAN  snapped at HERMLONE.
"for your information, POTTER, asphodel and wormWOOD make a sLEE_JORDANping potion so powerful a sLEE_JORDANping potion is known as the draught of living death.
a bezoar is a stone taken from the sTOMach of a goat and a bezoar will save you from most poisons.
as for monkshood and wolfsBANE, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.
well?
why aren't you all copying that down?"
there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment.
over the noise, professor SNAPE said, "and a point will be taken from GRYFFINDOR house for your cheek, "HARRY_POTTER."
things didn't improve for the GRYFFINDORs as the potions lesson continued.
professor SNAPE put them all into pairs and set them all to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
professor SNAPE swept around in professor SNAPE long black clOAK, watching them all weigh dried nettles and crush snake FANGs, criticizing almost everyone except MALFOY, whom professor SNAPE seemed to like.
professor SNAPE was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way MALFOY had stewed professor SNAPE horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.
professor SNAPE had somehow managed to melt SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's cauldron into a twisTED blob, and SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's cauldron potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes.
within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while professor SNAPE, who had been drenched in their potion when SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over professor SNAPE arms and legs.
"idiot boy!"
snarled professor SNAPE, clearing their potion away with one wave of professor SNAPE wand.
"i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's cauldron off the fire?"
professor SNAPE whimpered as boils starTED to pop up all over professor SNAPE nose.
"take professor SNAPE up to the hospital wing," SNAPE spat at SEAMUS_FINNIGAN .
then professor SNAPE rounded on HARRY_POTTER and ron, who had been working next to professor SNAPE.
"you -- POTTER -- why didn't you tell professor SNAPE not to add the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?
thought professor SNAPE'd make you look good if professor SNAPE got it wrong, did you?
that's another point you've lost for GRYFFINDOR ."
this was so unfair that HARRY_POTTER opened HARRY_POTTER mouth to argue, but ron kicked HARRY_POTTER behind their cauldron.
"doi* push it," doi muttered, "i've heard professor SNAPE can turn very nasty."
as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, HARRY_POTTER's mind was racing and HARRY_POTTER spirits were low.
HARRY_POTTER'd lost two points for GRYFFINDOR  in HARRY_POTTER very first week -- why did professor SNAPE hate HARRY_POTTER so much?
"cheer up," said ron, "professor SNAPE's always taking points off FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY.
can i come and meet hagrid
     with you?"
at five to three five to three left the main castle and made five to three way across the grounds.
hagrid
     lived in a small WOODen house on the edge of the forbidden forest.
a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.
when HARRY_POTTER knocked a crossbow and a pair of galoshes heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.
then hagrid
    's voice rang out, saying, "back, FANG -- back."
hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as HARRY_POTTER pulled the door open.
"hang on," HARRY_POTTER said.
"back, FANG."
HARRY_POTTER let back, FANG in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
there was only one room inside.
hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over a massive bed.
"make yerselves at home," said hagrid
    , letting go of FANG, who bounded straight at ron and starTED licking ron ears.
like hagrid
    , FANG was clearly not as fierce as ron looked.
"this is ron,HARRY_POTTER told hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
"another weasley, eh?"
said hagrid, glancing at ron's freckles.
i spent half me life CHASIN' yer twin brothers away from the forbidden forest."
the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke the rock cakes teeth, but HARRY_POTTER and ron pretended to be enjoying HARRY_POTTER and ron as HARRY_POTTER and ron told hagrid all about HARRY_POTTER and ron first -lessons.
FANG resTED FANG head on HARRY_POTTER's knee and drooled all over FANG robes.
HARRY_POTTER and ron were delighTED to hear hagrid
     call FITCH "that old git."
"an' as for that cat, mrs. NORRIS, i'd like ter introduce her to FANG sometime.
d'YEH know, every time i go up ter the school, her follows me everywhere?
can't get rid of her -- FITCH puts her up to it."
HARRY_POTTER told hagrid
     about professor SNAPE's lesson.
hagrid
    , like ron, told HARRY_POTTER not to worry about it, that professor SNAPE liked hardly any of the students.
"but professor SNAPE seemed to really hate me."
"rubbish!"
said hagrid
    .
"why should professor SNAPE?"
yet HARRY_POTTER couldn't help thinking that hagrid
     didn't quite meet professor SNAPE eyes when professor SNAPE said that.
"how's yer brother charlie?"
hagrid
     asked ron.
"i liked professor SNAPE a lot -- great with animals."
HARRY_POTTER wondered if hagrid
     had changed the subject on purpose.
while ron told hagrid
     all about charlie's work with dragons, HARRY_POTTER picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
it was a cutting from the daily PROPHET:
    GRINGOTTS break-in latest
    investigations continue into the break-in at GRINGOTTS on 31 july, widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown.
GRINGOTTS goblins today insisTED that nothing had been taken.
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
"but we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you," said a GRINGOTTS spokesgoblin this afternoon.
HARRY_POTTER remembered ron telling HARRY_POTTER on the train that someone had tried to rob GRINGOTTS, but ron hadn't mentioned the date.
"hagrid!"
said HARRY_POTTER, "that GRINGOTTS break-in happened on my birthday!
it might've been happening while we were there!"
there was no doubt about it, hagrid
     definitely didn't meet HARRY_POTTER's eyes this time.
hagrid
     grunTED and offered hagrid
     another rock cake.
HARRY_POTTER read the story again.
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.
hagrid
     had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call hagrid
     emptying, taking out that grubby little package.
had that been what the thieves were looking for?
as HARRY_POTTER and ron walked back to the castle for dinner, HARRY_POTTER and ron pockets weighed down with rock cakes their pockets'd been too polite to refuse, HARRY_POTTER thought that none of the lessons HARRY_POTTER'd had so far had GIVEN_HARRY as much to think about as tea with hagrid
    .
had hagrid
    collecTED that grubby little package just in time?
where was that grubby little package now?
and did hagrid
     know something about professor SNAPE that professor SNAPE didn't want to tell HARRY_POTTER?
chapter nine.
the midnight duel.
HARRY_POTTER had never believed HARRY_POTTER would meet a boy HARRY_POTTER haTED more than dudley, but that was before HARRY_POTTER met DRACO_MALFOY.
still, first-year GRYFFINDORs only had potions with the SLYTHERINS, so they didn't have to put up with MALFOY much.
or at least, they didn't until they spotTED a notice pinned up in the GRYFFINDOR common room that made them all groan.
flying lessons would be starting on thursday -- and GRYFFINDOR and SLYTHERINS would be learning together.
"typical," said HARRY_POTTER darkly.
"just what i always wanTED.
to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of MALFOY."
HARRY_POTTER had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
"you DON't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said ron reasonably.
"anyway, i know MALFOY's always going on about how good MALFOY is at quidditch, but i bet that's all talk."
MALFOY certainly did talk about flying a lot. "
MALFOY complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with "
    MALFOY narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters. "
MALFOY wasn't the only one, though: the way SEAMUS_FINNIGAN told it, "
    MALFOY'd spent most of "
    MALFOYchildhood zooming around the countryside on "
    MALFOY .
MR._RON would tell anyone who'd listen about the time "
    MALFOY'd almost hit a hang glider on charlie's old broom.
everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly.
ron had already had a big argument with DEAN_THOMAS, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.
roncouldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.
HARRY_POTTER had caught ron prodding DEAN_THOMAS's poster of west ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.
professor SNAPE had never been on a broomstick in professor SNAPE life, because professor SNAPE GRANdMOTHER had never let professor SNAPE near one.
privately, HARRY_POTTER felt his GRANdMOTHER'd had good reason, because professor SNAPE managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
HERMIONE_GRANGER was almost as nervous about flying as professor SNAPEwas.
this was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that his GRANdMOTHER hadn't tried.
at breakfast on thursday his GRANdMOTHER bored them all stupid with flying tips his GRANdMOTHER'd gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages.
professor SNAPE was hanging on to his GRANdMOTHER every word, desperate for anything that might help professor SNAPE hang on to a broomstick in front of MALFOY later, but everybody else was very pleased when HERMLONE's lecture was interrupTED by the arrival of the mail.
HARRY_POTTER hadn't had a single letter since hagrid
    's note, something that MALFOY had been quick to notice, of course.
MALFOY's eagle owl was always bringing MALFOY's eagle owl packages of sweets from home, which MALFOY's eagle owl opened gloatingly at the SLYTHERINS table.
a barn owl brought professor SNAPE a small package from his GRANdMOTHER.
professor SNAPE opened a small package from his GRANdMOTHER exciTEDly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
"it's a REMEMBRALL!"
professor SNAPE explained.
"GRAN knows i forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.
look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." professor SNAPE face fell, because the REMEMBRALL had suddenly glowed scarlet,
    "you've forgotten something..."
    professor SNAPE was trying to remember what "
    MR._LONGBOTTOM'd forgotten when DRACO_MALFOY, who was passing the GRYFFINDOR table, snatched the REMEMBRALLout of "
    MR._LONGBOTTOM hand.
HARRY_POTTER and ron jumped to HARRY_POTTER and ron feet.
HARRY_POTTER and ron were half hoping for a reason to fight MALFOY, but professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
"what's going on?"
"MALFOY's got my REMEMBRALL, professor."
scowling, MALFOY quickly dropped the REMEMBRALL back on the table.
"just looking," he said, and he sloped away with CRABBE and GOYLE behind he.
at three-thirty that afternoon, HARRY_POTTER, ron, and the other GRYFFINDORs hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for ron, and the other GRYFFINDORs first flying lesson.
it was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as their marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.
the SLYTHERINS were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.
HARRY_POTTER had heard FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY complain about the school brooms, saying that some of FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY starTED to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY teacher, MADAM_HOOCH, arrived.
she had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.
"well, what are you all waiting for?"
she barked.
"everyone stand by a broomstick.
come on, hurry up."
HARRY_POTTER glanced down at "
    HARRY_POTTER broom.
it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.
"stick out your right hand over his broom," called MADAM_HOOCH at the front, "and say 'up!"'
"upf everyone shouTED.
his broom jumped into HARRY_POTTER hand at once, but his broom was one of the few that did.
HERMIONE_GRANGER had simply rolled over on the ground, and professor SNAPE's hadn't moved at all.
perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought HARRY_POTTER; there was a quaver in professor SNAPE's voice that said only too clearly that HARRY_POTTER wanTED to keep HARRY_POTTER feet on the ground.
MADAM_HOOCH  then showed them how to mount them brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting them grips.
HARRY_POTTER and ron were delighTED when MADAM_HOOCH  told MALFOY MALFOY'd been doing it wrong for years.
"now, when i blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said MADAM_HOOCH .
"keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.
on my whistle -- three -- two --"
    but professor SNAPE, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before my whistle had touched MADAM_HOOCH hooch's lips.
"come back, boy!"
MADAM_HOOCH  shouTED, but professor SNAPE was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet.
HARRY_POTTERsaw HARRY_POTTER scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw HARRY_POTTER gasp, slip sideways off his broom and --
    wham -- a thud and a nasty crack and professor SNAPE lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
a broomstick in front of MALFOY was still rising higher and higher, and starTED to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
MADAM_HOOCH  was bending over professor SNAPE, MADAM_HOOCH  face as white as MADAM_HOOCH .
"broken wrist,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER heard MADAM_HOOCH  mutter.
"come on, boy -- it's all right, up you get.".
MADAM_HOOCH  turned to the rest of the class.
"none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing!
you leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of hogwarts before you can say 'quidditch.'
come on, dear."
professor SNAPE, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with MADAM_HOOCH, who had her arm around his.
no sooner were they out of earshot than MALFOY burst into laughter.
"did you see his face, the great lump?"
the other SLYTHERINS joined in.
"shut up, MALFOY," snapped PARVATI_PATIL.
"ooh, sticking up for longbotTOM?"
said PANSY_PARKINSON, a hard-faced SLYTHERINS girl.
"never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, parvati."
"look!"
said MALFOY, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.
"it's that stupid thing longbotTOM's GRAN sent him."
the REMEMBRALL glittered in the sun as him held the REMEMBRALL up.
"give that here, MALFOY," said HARRY_POTTER quietly.
everyone stopped talking to watch.
MALFOY smiled nastily.
"i think i'll leave it somewhere for longbotTOM to find -- how about -- up a tree?"
"give it here!"
HARRY_POTTER yelled, but MALFOY had leapt onto a broomstick in front of MALFOY and taken off.
HARRY_POTTER hadn't been lying, HARRY_POTTER could fly well.
hovering level with the topmost branches of an OAK HARRY_POTTER called, "come and get hovering level with the topmost branches of an OAK he called, POTTER!"
HARRY_POTTER grabbed his broom.
"no!"
shouTED HERMIONE_GRANGER.
"MADAM_HOOCH  told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble."
HARRY_POTTER ignored "
    HARRY_POTTER.
blood was pounding in "
    HARRY_POTTER ears. "
HARRY_POTTER mounTED his broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up "
    HARRY_POTTER soared; air rushed through "
    HARRY_POTTER hair, and "
    HARRY_POTTER robes whipped out behind "
    HARRY_POTTER -and in a rush of fierce joy "
    HARRY_POTTER realized "
    HARRY_POTTER'd found something "
    HARRY_POTTER could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. "
HARRY_POTTER pulled "
    HARRY_POTTER broomstick up a little to take his broomstick up a little even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron.
    "
HARRY_POTTER turned a broomstick in front of MALFOY sharply to face MALFOY in midair.
MALFOYlooked stunned.
"give it here,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER called, "or i'll knock you off that broom!"
"oh, yeah?"
said MALFOY, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
HARRY_POTTER knew, somehow, what to do.
HARRY_POTTER leaned forward and grasped his broom tightly in both hands, and his broom shot toward MALFOY like a javelin.
MALFOY only just got out of the way in time; HARRY_POTTER made a sharp about-face and held his broom steady.
a few people below were clapping.
"no CRABBE and GOYLE up here to save your neck, MALFOY," HARRY_POTTER called.
the same thought seemed to have struck MALFOY.
"catch it if you can, then!"
HARRY_POTTER shouTED, and HARRY_POTTER threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
HARRY_POTTER saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.
HARRY_POTTER leaned forward and poinTED his broom handle down -- next second HARRY_POTTER was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- HARRY_POTTER stretched out HARRY_POTTER hand -- a foot from the ground HARRY_POTTER caught it, just in time to pull his broomstraight, and HARRY_POTTER toppled gently onto the grass with the REMEMBRALLclutched safely in HARRY_POTTER fist.
POTTER!"
HARRY_POTTER heart sank faster than HARRY_POTTER'd just dived.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was running toward them.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  got to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  , trembling.
"never -- in all my time at hogwarts --professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  was almost speechless with shock, and professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL
glasses flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"
    "it wasn't professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  fault, professor --"
    "be quiet, miss PATIL
    "but MALFOY --"
    "that's enough, GEORGE_WEASLEY.
POTTER, follow me, now."
HARRY_POTTER caught sight of MALFOY, CRABBE, and GOYLE's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's wake as professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  strode toward the castle.
he was going to be expelled, he just knew it.
he wanTED to say something to defend he, but there seemed to be something wrong with he voice.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was sweeping along without even looking at professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL ; professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  had to jog to keep up.
now professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL 'd DONe it.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  hadn't even lasTED two weeks.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL 'd be packing professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  bags in ten minutes.
what would the DURSLEYS say when professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  turned up on the doorstep?
up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  didn't say a word to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL .
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with HARRY_POTTER trotting miserably behind professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL .
maybe professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  was taking professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  to dumbledore.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  thought of hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.
perhaps professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL
could be hagrid's assistant.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  sTOMach twisTED as professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  imagined it, watching ron and the others becoming wizards, while professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid's bag.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  stopped outside a classroom.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  opened the door and poked professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  head inside.
"excuse me, professor FLITWICK, could i borrow WOOD for a MOMent?"
WOOD?
thought HARRY_POTTER, bewildered; was WOOD a cane professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  was going to use on HARRY_POTTER?
but "
    WOOD turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confused.
"follow me, you two," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL , and they marched on up the corridor, "
    WOOD looking curiously at HARRY_POTTER.
"in here."
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  poinTED them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
"out, peeves!"
she barked.
peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and peeves swooped out cursing.
professorslammed the door behind professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  and turned to face the two boys.
"POTTER, this is "
    WOOD. "
WOOD i've found you a seeker."
WOOD's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
"are you serious, professor?"
"absolutely," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  crisply.
"the boy's a natural.
i've never seen anything like the boy's .
was that your first time on a broomstick, POTTER?"
HARRY_POTTER nodded silently. "
HARRY_POTTER didn't have a clue what was going on, but "
    HARRY_POTTER didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling starTED coming back to "
    HARRY_POTTER legs.
". "
HARRY_POTTER caught that thing in "
    HARRY_POTTER hand after a fifty-foot dive," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  told "
    WOOD.
"didn't even scratch "
    HARRY_POTTER.
GEORGE_WEASLEY couldn't have DONe it."
WOOD was now looking as though all GEORGE_WEASLEY dreams had come true at once.
"ever seen a game of quidditch, POTTER?"
he asked exciTEDly.
"WOOD's captain of the GRYFFINDOR team," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL explained.
"he's just the build for a seeker, too," said WOOD, now walking around HARRY_POTTER and staring at he.
"light -- speedy -- we'll have to get he a decent broom, professor -- a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven, i'd say."
i shall speak to dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule.
heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
flattened in that last match by SLYTHERINS, i couldn't look SEVERUS_SNAPE in the face for weeks....professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  peered sternly over professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  glasses at HARRY_POTTER.
"i want to hear you're training hard, POTTER, or i may change my mind about punishing you."
then professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  suddenly smiled.
"your father would have been proud," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  said.
"your father was an excellent quidditch player himself."
"you're joking."
it was dinnertime.
HARRY_POTTER had just finished telling ron what had happened when HARRY_POTTER'd left the grounds with professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL .
ronhad a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to ron mouth, but ron'd forgotten all about it.
"seeker?"
ron said.
"but first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said HARRY_POTTER, shoveling pie into his mouth.
HARRY_POTTER felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon.
". "
WOOD told me.MR._RON was so amazed, so impressed, HARRY_POTTER just sat and gaped at HARRY_POTTER.
"i start training next week," said HARRY_POTTER.
"only DON't tell anyone, "
    WOOD wants to keep "
    WOOD a secret."
FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY now came into the hall, spotTED HARRY_POTTER, and hurried over.
"well DONe," said GEORGE_WEASLEY in a low voice.
". "
WOOD told HARRY_POTTER, .
HARRY_POTTER, 're on the team too -- beaters."
"i tell you, HARRY_POTTER, 're going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year," said "
    FRED_WEASLEY.
"HARRY_POTTER,  haven't won since charlie  left, but this yearis going to be brilliant.
you must be good, HARRY_POTTER, WOOD was almost skipping when charlie  told HARRY_POTTER, ."
"anyway, HARRY_POTTER, 've got to go, charlie  reckons charlie 's found a new secret passageway out of the school."
"bet it's that one behind the statue of GREGORY_THE_SMARMY that HARRY_POTTER,  found in HARRY_POTTER,  first week.
see you."
"
    FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: MALFOY, flanked by CRABBE and GOYLE.
"having a last meal, POTTER?
when are you getting the train back to the muggles?"
"you're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," said HARRY_POTTER coolly.
there was of course nothing at all little about CRABBE and GOYLE, but as the high table was full of teachers, neither of teachers could do more than crack teachers knuckles and scowl.
"i'd take you on anytime on my own," said MALFOY.
"tonight, if you want.
wizard's duel.
wands only -- no contact.
what's the matter?
never heard of a wizard's duel before, i suppose?"
"of course he has," said ron, wheeling around.
"i'm he second, who's he?"
MALFOY looked at CRABBE and GOYLE, sizing CRABBE and GOYLE up.
CRABBE and GOYLE," "
    MALFOY said.
"midnight all right?
we'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked."
when MALFOY had gone, ron and HARRY_POTTER looked at each other.
"what is a wizard's duel?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"and what do you mean, you're my second?"
"well, a second's there to take over if you die," said roncasually, getting starTED at last on ron cold pie.
catching the look on HARRY_POTTER's face, ron added quickly, "but people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.
the most you and MALFOY'll be able to do is send sparks at each other.
neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage.
i bet ron expecTED you to refuse, anyway."
"and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens?"
"throw it away and punch ron on the nose," ron suggesTED.
"excuse me."
they both looked up.
it was HERMIONE_GRANGER.
"can't a person eat in peace in this place?"
said ron.
HERMLONE ignored ron and spoke to HARRY_POTTER.
"i couldn't help overhearing what you and MALFOY were saying --"
    "bet you could," ron muttered.
    "
--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose GRYFFINDOR if you're caught, and you're bound to be.
it's really very selfish of you."
"and it's really none of your business," said HARRY_POTTER.
"good-bye," said ron.
all the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, HARRY_POTTER thought, as HARRY_POTTER lay awake much later listening to DEAN_THOMAS and SEAMUS_FINNIGAN falling asLEE_JORDANp (MR._LONGBOTTOM wasn't back from the hospital wing).
ron had spent all evening giving ron advice such as "if ron tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because i can't remember how to block advice such."
there was a very good chance advice such were going to get caught by FILCH or mrs. NORRIS, and HARRY_POTTER felt HARRY_POTTER was pushing HARRY_POTTER luck, breaking another school rule today.
on the other hand, MALFOYs sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was HARRY_POTTER big chance to beat MALFOY face-to-face.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't miss it.
"half-past eleven," ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
"we pulled on "we bathrobes, picked up "we wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the GRYFFINDOR common room.
a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.
all the armchairs had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest all the armchairs, "i can't believe you're going to do this, HARRY_POTTER."
a lamp flickered on.
a lamp flickered on was HERMIONE_GRANGER, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.
"you!"
said ron furiously.
"go back to bed!"
"i almost told your brother," HERMLONE snapped, "PERCY_WEASLEY -- PERCY_WEASLEY's a prefect, PERCY_WEASLEY'd put a stop to this."
HARRY_POTTER couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
"come on," HARRY_POTTER said to ron.
HARRY_POTTER pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the portrait hole.
HERMLONE wasn't going to give up that easily.
HERMLONE followed ronthrough the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
"DON't you care about GRYFFINDOR, do you only care about yourselves, i DON't want SLYTHERINS to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points i got from professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  for knowing about switching spells."
"go away."
"all right, but i warned you, you just remember what i said when you're on the train home TOMorrow, you're so --"
    but what they were, they didn't find out.
HERMLONE had turned to the portrait of the fat lady the fat lady to get back inside and found the fat lady facing an empty painting.
the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and HERMLONE was locked out of GRYFFINDOR tower.
"now what am i going to do?"
the fat lady asked shrilly.
"that's your problem," said ron.
"we've got to go, we 3 re going to be late."
they hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when HERMLONEcaught up with they.
"i'm coming with you," the fat lady said.
"you are not."
"d'you think i'm going to stand out here and wait for FILCH to catch me?
if d'you finds all three of we i'll tell d'you the truth, that i was trying to stop you, and you can back me up."
"you've got some nerve --" said ron loudly.
"shut up, both of you!"
said HARRY_POTTER sharply.
i heard something."
it was a sort of snuffling.
"mrs.
NORRIS?"
breathed ron, squinting through the dark.
it wasn't mrs. NORRIS.
it was MR._LONGBOTTOM.
MR._LONGBOTTOM was curled up on the floor, fast asLEE_JORDANp, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
"thank goodness you found me!
i've been out here for hours, i couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed."
"keep your voice down, MR._LONGBOTTOM.
the new password to get in to bed's 'pig snout' but the new password to get in to bed won't help you now, the fat lady's gone off somewhere."
"how's your arm?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"fine," said MR._LONGBOTTOM, showing them.
"MADAM_POMFTEY mended it in about a minute."
"good - well, look, MR._LONGBOTTOM, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later --"
    "DON't leave me!"
said MR._LONGBOTTOM, scrambling to MR._LONGBOTTOM feet, "i DON't want to stay here alone, the bloody BARON's been past twice already.MR._RON looked at ron watch and then glared furiously at HERMLONEand MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"if either of you get we caught, i'll never rest until i've learned that curse of the bogies QUIRTELL told we about, and used it on you.
HERMLONE opened HERMLONE mouth, perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies, but HARRY_POTTER hissed at HERMLONE to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
them flitTED along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows.
at every turn HARRY_POTTER expecTED to run into FILCH or mrs. NORRIS, but them were lucky.
them sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
MALFOY and CRABBE weren't there yet.
the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught MALFOY and CRABBE.
cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness.
cups, shields, plates, and statues edged along the walls, keeping cups, shields, plates, and statues eyes on the doors at either end of the trophy room.
HARRY_POTTER took out HARRY_POTTER wand in case MALFOY leapt in and starTED at once.
the minutes crept by.
"HARRY_POTTER's late, maybe HARRY_POTTER's chickened out," ron whispered.
then a noise in the trophy room made them jump.
HARRY_POTTER had only just raised his wand when them heard someone speak -and it wasn't MALFOY.
"sniff around, my sweet, them might be lurking in a corner."
it was FILCH speaking to mrs. NORRIS.
horror-struck, HARRY_POTTER waved madly at the other three to follow HARRY_POTTER as quickly as possible; them scurried silently toward the door, away from FILCH's voice.
MR._LONGBOTTOM's robes had barely whipped round a corner when MR._LONGBOTTOM's robes heard FILCHenter the trophy room.
"MR._LONGBOTTOM's robes're in here somewhere," MR._LONGBOTTOM's robes heard FILCH mutter, "probably hiding."
"this way!"
HARRY_POTTER mouthed to the others and, petrified, the others began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
the others could hear FILCH getting nearer.
MR._LONGBOTTOM suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed ron around the waist, and the pair of the others toppled right into a suit of armor.
the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
"run!"
HARRY_POTTER yelled, and the four of the others sprinTED down a long gallery full of suits of armor, not looking back to see whether FILCH was following -- the others swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, HARRY_POTTER in the lead, without any idea where the others were or where the others were going -- the others ripped through a tapestry and found the others in a hidden passageway, hurtled along the doorpost and came out near the others charms classroom, which the others knew was miles from the trophy room.
"i think we've lost him," HARRY_POTTER panTED, leaning against the cold wall and wiping him forehead.
MR._LONGBOTTOM was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.
i -- told -you," HERMLONE gasped, clutching at the stitch in MR._LONGBOTTOM chest, "i -- told -- you."
"we've got to get back to GRYFFINDOR tower," said ron, "quickly as possible."
"MALFOY tricked you," HERMLONE said to HARRY_POTTER.
"you realize that, DON't you?
him was never going to meet you -- FILCH knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, MALFOY must have tipped someone  off."
HARRY_POTTER thought "
    HARRY_POTTER was probably right, but him wasn't going to tell "
    HARRY_POTTER that.
"let's go."
it wasn't going to be that simple.
they hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of they.
it was peeves.
him caught sight of they and gave a squeal of delight.
"shut up, peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
peeves cackled.
"wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties?
tut, tut, tut.
naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty."
"not if you DON't give us away, peeves, please."
"should tell FILCH, i should," said peeves in a saintly voice, but peeves eyes glittered wickedly.
"it's for your own good, you know."
"get out of the way," snapped ron, taking a swipe at peevesthis was a big mistake.
"students out of bed!"
peeves CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed, "students out of bed down the charms corridor"
    ducking under peeves, they ran for they lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door was locked.
"this is it!"
ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "they're DONe for!
this is the end!"
they could hear footsteps, FILCH running as fast as ron could toward peeves's shouts.
"oh, move over," HERMLONE snarled.
HERMLONE grabbed HARRY_POTTER's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'alohomora!"
the lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through "
    the lock, shut "
    the lock quickly, and pressed they ears against "
    the lock, listening.
"which way did they go, peeves?"
FILCH was saying.
"quick, tell me."
"say 'please."'
"DON't mess with me, peeves, now where did they go?"
"shan't say nothing if you DON't say please," said peeves in peeves annoying singsong voice.
"all right -please."
"nothing!
ha haaa!
told you i wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please!
ha ha!
haaaaaa!"
and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and FILCH cursing in rage.
"peeves thinks the door is locked,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"i think we'll be okay -- get off, MR._LONGBOTTOM!"
for MR._LONGBOTTOM had been tugging on the sLEE_JORDANve of HARRY_POTTER's bathrobe for the last minute.
"what?"
HARRY_POTTER turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what.
for a MOMent, peeves was sure peeves'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
they weren't in a room, as peeves had supposed.
they were in a corridor.
the forbidden corridor on the third floor.
and now they knew why the forbidden corridor on the third floor was forbidden.
they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.
the forbidden corridor on the third floor had three heads.
three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching
    and quivering in they direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish FANGs.
it was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at they, and HARRY_POTTER knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that they sudden appearance had taken their sudden appearance by surprise, but their sudden appearance was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
HARRY_POTTER groped for the doorknob -- between FILCH and death, HARRY_POTTER'd take FILCH.
they fell backward -- HARRY_POTTER slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down a corridor.
FILCH must have hurried off to look for they somewhere else, because they didn't see FILCH anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanTED to do was put as much space as possible between they and that monster.
they didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady the fat lady on the seventh floor.
"where on earth have you all been?"
she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panTED HARRY_POTTER, and the portrait swung forward.
their scrambled into the trophy roomand collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
it was a while before any of their said anything.
MR._LONGBOTTOM, indeed, looked as if MR._LONGBOTTOM'd never speak again.
"what do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"
said ron finally.
"if any dog needs exercise, that one does."
HERMLONE had got both HERMLONE breath and HERMLONE bad temper back again.
"you DON't use your eyes, any of you, do you?"
HERMLONE snapped.
"didn't you see what it was standing on.
"the floor?"
HARRY_POTTER suggesTED.
"i wasn't looking at it feet, i was too busy with it heads."
"no, not the floor.
not the floor was standing on a trapdoor.
it's obviously guarding something."
she stood up, glaring at them.
i hope you're pleased with yourselves.
we could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.
now, if you DON't mind, i'm going to bed.MR._RON stared after she, ron mouth open.
"no, we DON't mind," ron said.
"you'd think we dragged she along, wouldn't you.
but HERMLONE had GIVEN_HARRY something else to think about as HARRY_POTTER climbed back into bed.
the dog was guarding something.... what had hagrid said?
GRINGOTTS was the safest place in the world for something you wanTED to hide -- except perhaps hogwarts.
GRINGOTTS looked as though HARRY_POTTER had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
chapter ten.
halloween.
MALFOY couldn't believe MALFOY eyes when MALFOY saw that HARRY_POTTER and ronwere still at hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
indeed, by the next morning HARRY_POTTER and ron  thought that meeting the dog had been an excellent adventure, and HARRY_POTTER and ron  were quite keen to have another one.
in the meantime, HARRY_POTTERfilled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from GRINGOTTS to hogwarts, and HARRY_POTTER and ron  spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
"it's either really valuable or really dangerous," said ron.
"or both," said HARRY_POTTER.
but as all HARRY_POTTER and ron  knew for sure about the mysterious object was that the mysterious object was about two inches long, HARRY_POTTER and ron  didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.
neither MR._LONGBOTTOM nor HERMLONE showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
MR._LONGBOTTOM's  cared about was never going near the dog again.
HERMLONE was now refusing to speak to HARRY_POTTER and ron , but HERMLONE was such a bossy know-it-all that HARRY_POTTER and ron  saw this as an added bonus.
all HARRY_POTTER and ron  really wanTED now was a way of getting back at MALFOY, and to HARRY_POTTER and ron  great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.
HARRY_POTTER was just as interesTED as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped this large parcel right in front of HARRY_POTTER, knocking HARRY_POTTER bacon to the third floor.
the owls had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of this large parcel.
HARRY_POTTER ripped open a letter on top of the parcel first, which was lucky, because a letter on top of the parcel said:
    do not open this large parcel at the table.
a letter on top of the parcel contains your new nimbus two thousand, but i DON't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or everybody'll all want one.
OLIVER_WOOD will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.
HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER had difficulty hiding HARRY_POTTER gLEE_JORDAN as HARRY_POTTER handed the note to ron to read.
"a nimbus two thousand!"
ron moaned enviously.
"i've never even touched one."
they left the great hall quickly, wanting to unwrap a broomstick in private before they first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by CRABBE and GOYLE.
MALFOYseized the package from HARRY_POTTER and felt the package.
"that's a broomstick," he said, throwing the package back to HARRY_POTTER with a mixture of jealousy and spite on HARRY_POTTER face.
"you'll be in for it this time, POTTER, first years aren't allowed POTTER."
ron couldn't resist it.
"it's not any old broomstick," ron said, "it's a nimbus two thousand.
what did you say you've got at home, MALFOY, a comet two sixty?"
ron grinned at HARRY_POTTER.
"comets look flashy, but comets're not in the same league as the nimbus."
"what would you know about it, weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle," MALFOY snapped back.
"i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig."
before ron could answer, professor FLITWICK appeared at MALFOY's elbow.
"not arguing, i hope, boys?"
professor FLITWICK squeaked.
"POTTER's been sent a broomstick, professor," said MALFOYquickly.
"yes, yes, that's right," said professor FLITWICK, beaming at HARRY_POTTER.
"professor FLITWICK told me all about the special circumstances, POTTER.
and what model is it?"
"a nimbus two thousand, sit," said HARRY_POTTER, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on MALFOY's face.
"and it's really thanks to MALFOY here that i've got it," he added.
HARRY_POTTER and ron  headed upstairs, sMOTHERing HARRY_POTTER and ron  laughter at MALFOY's obvious rage and confusion.
"well, it's true," HARRY_POTTER chortled as " HARRY_POTTER  reached the top of the marble staircase, "if HARRY_POTTER
hadn't stolen MR._LONGBOTTOM's REMEMBRALL i wouln't be on the team...."
    "so i suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?"
came an angry voice from just behind them.
HERMLONE was sTOMping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in HARRY_POTTER's hand.
"i thought you weren't speaking to us?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"yes, DON't stop now," said ron, "it's doing us so much good.HERMLONE marched away with HERMLONE nose in the air.
HARRY_POTTER had a lot of trouble keeping HARRY_POTTER mind on HARRY_POTTER lessons that day.
it kept wandering up to the dormitory where HARRY_POTTER new broomstick was lying under HARRY_POTTER bed, or straying off to the quidditch field where HARRY_POTTER'd be learning to play that night.
HARRY_POTTER bolTED HARRY_POTTER dinner that evening without noticing what HARRY_POTTER was eating, and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last.
"wow," ron sighed, as his new broomstick  rolled onto HARRY_POTTER's bedspread.
even HARRY_POTTER, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.
sLEE_JORDANk and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top.
as seven o'clock drew nearer, HARRY_POTTER left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field.
held never been inside the stadium before.
hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.
at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.
they reminded HARRY_POTTER of the little plastic sticks muggle
    children blew bubbles through, except that muggle
    children were fifty feet high.
too eager to fly again to wait for OLIVER_WOOD, HARRY_POTTER mounTED his new broomstick  and kicked off from the ground.
what a feeling -- HARRY_POTTER swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.
the nimbus two thousand turned wherever HARRY_POTTER wanTED at HARRY_POTTER lightest touch.
"hey, POTTER, come down!'
OLIVER_WOOD had arrived.
fie was carrying a large WOODen crate under fie arm.
HARRY_POTTER landed next to fie.
"very nice," said WOOD, HARRY_POTTER eyes glinting.
"i see what professor FLITWICK meant... you really are a natural.
i'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
MINERVA_MCGONAGALL  opened a large WOODen crate .
inside were four different-sized balls.
"right," said OLIVER_WOOD.
"now, quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play.
there are seven players on each side.
three of seven players on each side are called chasers."
"three chasers,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER repeaTED, as OLIVER_WOOD took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
"a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball's called the quaffle," said OLIVER_WOOD.
"the chasersthrow the quaffle to each other and try and get the quaffle through one of the hoops to score a goal.
ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops.
follow me?"
"the chasers throw the quaffle and put the quaffle through the hoops to score," HARRY_POTTER reciTED.
"so -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?"
"what's basketball?"
said OLIVER_WOOD curiously.
"never mind," said HARRY_POTTER quickly.
"now, there's another player on each side who's called the keeper -i'm keeper for GRYFFINDOR.
i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring."
"three chasers, one keeper," said HARRY_POTTER, who was determined to remember it all.
"and they play with the quaffle.
okay, got that.
so what are they for?"
he poinTED at the three balls left inside the box.
"i'll show you now," said OLIVER_WOOD.
"take this."
he handed HARRY_POTTER a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
"i'm going to show you what the bludgers do," OLIVER_WOOD said.
"these two are the bludgers."
he showed HARRY_POTTER two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the quafflethe quaffle.
HARRY_POTTER noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding they inside the box.
"stand back," WOOD warned HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER bent down and freed one of the bludgers.
at once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelTED straight at HARRY_POTTER's face.
HARRY_POTTER swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking HARRY_POTTER nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at WOOD, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
"see?"
WOOD panTED, forcing the struggling bludger back into a large WOODen crate  and strapping a large WOODen crate  down safely.
"the bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off players brooms.
that's why you have the beaters -- the weasley twins are ours -- it's the weasley twinsjob to protect the weasley twins side from the bludgers and try and knock the weasley twins toward the other team.
so -- think you've got all that?"
"three chasers try and score with the quaffle; the keeper guards the goal posts; the beaters keep the bludgers away from three chasers team," HARRY_POTTER reeled off.
"very good," said OLIVER_WOOD.
"er -- have the bludgers ever killed anyone?"
HARRY_POTTER asked, hoping HARRY_POTTER sounded offhand.
"never at hogwarts.
we've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that.
now, the last member of the team is the
    seeker.
that's you.
and you DON't have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open."
"DON't worry, the MRS._WEASLEY are more than a match for the bludgers-- i mean, the MRS._WEASLEY're like a pair of the bludgers."
WOOD reached into a large WOODen crate  and took out the fourth and last ball.
compared with the quaffle and the bludgers, "
    WOOD was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. "
WOOD was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.
"this," said "
    WOOD, "is the GOLDEN_SNITCH, and it's the most important ball of the lot.
it's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see.
it's the seeker's job to catch it.
you've got to weave in and out of the chasers, beaters, bludgers, and quaffle to get it before the other team's seeker, because whichever seeker catches the GOLDEN_SNITCH wins the GOLDEN_SNITCH team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they
    nearly always win.
that's why seekers get fouled so much.
a game of quidditch only ends when the GOLDEN_SNITCH is caught, so it can go on for ages -- i think the record is three months, a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sLEE_JORDANp.
"well, that's it -- any questions?"
HARRY_POTTER shook HARRY_POTTER head.
HARRY_POTTER understood what HARRY_POTTER had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.
"we won't practice with the GOLDEN_SNITCH yet," said WOOD, carefully shutting it back inside a large WOODen crate , "it's too dark, we might lose it.
let's try you out with a few of these."
HARRY_POTTER pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of HARRY_POTTER pocket and a few minutes later, HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER were up in the air, "
    WOOD throwing the golf balls as hard as HARRY_POTTER could in every direction for HARRY_POTTER to catch.
HARRY_POTTER didn't miss a single one, and "
    WOOD was delighTED.
after half an hour, night had really fallen and he and HARRY_POTTER couldn't carry on.
"that quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said WOOD happily as he and HARRY_POTTER trudged back up to the castle.
"i wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than MRS._CHARLIE, and MRS._CHARLIE could have played for england if MRS._CHARLIE hadn't gone off CHASINg dragons."
perhaps it was because MRS._CHARLIE was now so busy, what with quidditchpractice three evenings a week on top of all MRS._CHARLIE homework, but HARRY_POTTER could hardly believe it when HARRY_POTTER realized that HARRY_POTTER'd already been at hogwarts two months.
the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had.
HARRY_POTTER lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that his lessons had mastered the basics.
on halloween morning his lessons woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.
even better, professor FLITWICK announced in charms that professor FLITWICK thought his lessons were ready to start making objects fly, something his lessons had all been dying to try since his lessons'd seen professor FLITWICK make MR._LONGBOTTOM's toad zoom around the classroom.
professor FLITWICK put the class into pairs to practice.
HARRY_POTTER's partner was SEAMUS_FINNIGAN (which was a relief, because MR._LONGBOTTOM had been trying to catch MR._LONGBOTTOM eye).
ron, however, was to be working with HERMIONE_GRANGER.
it was hard to tell whether ron or HERMLONE was angrier about this.
HERMLONE hadn't spoken to either of ron or HERMLONE since the day his new broomstick  had arrived.
"now, DON't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
squeaked professor FLITWICK, perched on top of professor FLITWICK pile of books as usual.
"swish and flick, remember, swish and flick.
and saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget WIZARD_BARUFFIO, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on himself chest."
it was very difficult.
HARRY_POTTER and SEAMUS_FINNIGAN swished and flicked, but the feather HARRY_POTTER and SEAMUS_FINNIGAN were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
SEAMUS_FINNIGAN got so impatient that SEAMUS_FINNIGAN prodded it with SEAMUS_FINNIGAN wand and set fire to it -- HARRY_POTTER had to put it out with HARRY_POTTER hat.
ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
"wingardium leviosa!"
ron shouTED, waving ron long arms like a windmill.
"you're saying it wrong,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER heard HERMLONE snap.
"it's wing-gar-dium levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."
"you do it, then, if you're so clever," ron snarled.
HERMLONE rolled up the sLEE_JORDANves of HERMLONE gown, flicked HERMLONE wand, and said, "wingardium leviosa!"
their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.
"oh, well DONe!"
cried professor FLITWICK, clapping.
"everyone see here, MR._GRANGER's DONe it!"
ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.
"it's no wonder no one can stand her," "
    ron said to HARRY_POTTER as they pushed they way into the crowded corridor, "her's a nightmare, honestly. "
someone knocked into HARRY_POTTER as they hurried past "
    someone.
it was HERMLONE.
HARRY_POTTER caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that her was in tears.
"i think her heard you."
"so?"
said ron, but ron looked a bit uncomfortable.
"her must've noticed her's got no friends."
HERMLONE didn't turn up for the class and wasn't seen all afternoon.
on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast, HARRY_POTTER and ron overheard PARVATI_PATIL telling her friend lavender that HERMLONE was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanTED to be left alone.
ron looked still more awkward at this, but a MOMent later they had entered the great hall, where the halloween decorations put HERMLONE out of they minds.
a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.
the halloween feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as the halloween feast had at the start-of-term banquet.
HARRY_POTTER was just helping HARRY_POTTER to a baked potato when professor QUIRTELL came sprinting into the great hall, HARRY_POTTER turban askew and terror on HARRY_POTTER face.
everyone stared as HARRY_POTTER reached professor dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, "troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know."
HARRY_POTTER then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
there was an uproar.
an uproar took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore's wand to bring silence.
"prefects," HARRY_POTTER rumbled, "lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately!"
PERCY_WEASLEY was in "
    PERCY_WEASLEY element.
"follow me!
stick together, first years!
no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders!
stay close behind "
    PERCY_WEASLEY, now.
make way, first years coming through!
excuse me, i'm a prefect!"
"how could a troll get in?"
HARRY_POTTER asked as a troll climbed the stairs.
"DON't ask me, a troll're supposed to be really stupid," said ron.
"maybe peeves let peeves in for a halloween joke."
a troll passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
as a troll jostled a troll way through a crowd of confused HUFFLEPUFFS, HARRY_POTTER suddenly grabbed ron's arm.
"i've just thought -- HERMLONE."
"what about HERMLONE?"
"HERMLONE doesn't know about the troll."
ron bit "
    ron lip.
"oh, all right," "
    ron snapped.
"but PERCY_WEASLEY'd better not see us."
ducking down, they joined confused HUFFLEPUFFS going the other way, slipped down a deserTED side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom.
they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind they.
"PERCY_WEASLEY!"
hissed ron, pulling HARRY_POTTER behind a large stone griffin.
peering around a large stone griffin, however, they saw not PERCY_WEASLEY but SNAPE.
PERCY_WEASLEY crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.
"what's PERCY_WEASLEY doing?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"why isn't PERCY_WEASLEY down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?"
"search me."
quietly as possible, they crept along the corridor after SNAPE's fading footsteps.
"PERCY_WEASLEY's heading for the third floor," HARRY_POTTER said, but ron held up PERCY_WEASLEY hand.
"can you smell something?HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER sniffed and a foul stench reached HARRY_POTTER nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
and then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.
ron poinTED -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward they.
they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
it was a horrible sight.
twelve feet tall, it skin was a dull, GRANite gray, its skin great lumpy body like a boulder with its skin small bald head perched on top like a coconut.
its skin had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.
the smell coming from its skin was incredible.
the smell coming from it was holding a huge WOODen club, which dragged along the third floor because the smell coming from it arms were so long.
the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.
the troll waggled the troll long ears, making up the troll tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
"the keys in the lock," HARRY_POTTER muttered.
"we could lock the troll in."
"good idea," said ron nervously.
the troll edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the trollwasn't about to come out of the troll.
with one great leap, HARRY_POTTER managed to grab the key, slam the open door, and lock the key.
'yes!"
flushed with the troll victory, the troll starTED to run back up the passage, but as the troll reached the corner the troll heard something that made the troll hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber the troll'd just chained up.
"oh, no," said ron, pale as the bloody BARON.
"it's the girls' bathroom!"
HARRY_POTTER gasped.
"HERMLONE!"
ron, pale as the bloody BARON said together.
it was the last thing ron, pale as the bloody BARON wanTED to do, but what choice did ron, pale as the bloody BARON have?
wheeling around, ron, pale as the bloody BARON sprinTED back to the open door and turned the key, fumbling in ron, pale as the bloody BARON panic.
HARRY_POTTER pulled the open door open and ron, pale as the bloody BARON ran inside.
HERMIONE_GRANGER was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if HERMIONE_GRANGER was about to faint.
the troll was advancing on HERMIONE_GRANGER, knocking the sinks off the walls as the troll went.
"confuse it!"
HARRY_POTTER said desperately to ron, and, seizing a tap, HARRY_POTTER threw a tap as hard as HARRY_POTTER could against the wall.
the troll stopped a few feet from HERMLONE.
the troll lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.
the troll mean little eyes saw HARRY_POTTER.
the troll hesitaTED, then made for HARRY_POTTER instead, lifting the troll club as the troll went.
"oy, pea-brain!"
yelled ron from the other side of the chamber, and ron threw a metal pipe at a metal pipe.
the troll didn't even seem to notice a metal pipe hitting the troll shoulder, but a metal pipe heard the yell and paused again, turning a metal pipe ugly snout toward ron instead, giving HARRY_POTTER time to run around its ugly snout.
"come on, run, run!"
HARRY_POTTER yelled at HERMLONE, trying to pull HERMLONE toward the open door, but HERMLONE couldn't move, HERMLONE was still flat against the wall, HERMLONE mouth open with terror.
the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the trollberserk.
the troll roared again and starTED toward ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.
HARRY_POTTER then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: HARRY_POTTER took a great running jump and managed to fasten HARRY_POTTER arms around the troll's neck from behind.
the troll couldn't feel HARRY_POTTERhanging there, but the troll will notice if you stick a long bit of WOOD up the troll nose, and HARRY_POTTER's wand had still been in HARRY_POTTER hand when HARRY_POTTER'd jumped -- HARRY_POTTER's wand had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
howling with pain, the troll twisTED and flailed the troll club, with HARRY_POTTER clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip HARRY_POTTER off or catch HARRY_POTTER a terrible blow with the club.
HERMLONE had sunk to the third floor in fright; ron pulled out ron own wand -- not knowing what ron was going to do ron heard ron cry the first spell that came into ron head: "wingardium leviosa!"
the club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto the club owner's head.
the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on the troll face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
HARRY_POTTER got to HARRY_POTTER feet.
HARRY_POTTER was shaking and out of breath.
ronwas standing there with HARRY_POTTER's wand still raised, staring at what ron had DONe.
it was HERMLONE who spoke first.
"is it -- dead?"
i DON't think so," said HARRY_POTTER, i think it's just been knocked out."
HARRY_POTTER bent down and pulled HARRY_POTTER's wand out of the troll's nose.
the troll's nose was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
"urgh -- troll boogers."
ron wiped it on the troll's trousers.
a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.
them hadn't realized what a racket them had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars.
a MOMent later, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had come bursting into the whole room, closely followed by SNAPE, with professor QUIRTELLbringing up the rear.
QUIRTELL took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL heart.
SNAPE bent over the troll.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was looking at ron and HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER had never seen HARRY_POTTER look so angry.
HARRY_POTTER lips were white.
hopes of winning fifty points for GRYFFINDOR faded quickly from HARRY_POTTER's mind.
"what on earth were you thinking of?"
said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, with cold fury in HARRY_POTTER voice.
HARRY_POTTER looked at ron, who was still standing with HARRY_POTTER wand in the air.
"you're lucky you weren't killed.
why aren't you in your dormitory?SNAPE gave HARRY_POTTER a swift, piercing look.
HARRY_POTTER looked at the floor.
HARRY_POTTER wished ron would put HARRY_POTTER's wand down.
then a small voice came out of the shadows.
"please, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL -- they were looking for professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL."
"MR._GRANGER!"
HERMLONE had managed to get to his feet at last.
i went looking for the troll because i -- i thought i could deal with the troll on my own -- you know, because i've read all about the troll."
ron dropped HARRY_POTTER's wand.
HERMIONE_GRANGER, telling a downright lie to a teacher?
"if they hadn't found me, i'd be dead now.
HARRY_POTTER stuck HARRY_POTTER wand up its nose and ron knocked its out with its own club.
they didn't have time to come and fetch anyone.
it was about to finish me off when they arrived."
HARRY_POTTER and ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to they.
"well -- in that case..." said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, staring at the three of them, "MR._GRANGER, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
HERMLONE hung his head.
HARRY_POTTER was speechless.
HERMLONE was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here HERMLONE was, pretending HERMLONE had, to get them out of trouble.
it was as if SNAPE had starTED handing out sweets.
".
"MR._GRANGER, five points will be taken from GRYFFINDOR for this," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"i'm very disappoinTED in you.
if you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to GRYFFINDOR tower.
students are finishing the feast in students houses.HERMLONE left.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL turned to "
    HARRY_POTTER and ron.
"well, i still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.
you each win GRYFFINDOR five points.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL will be informed of this.
you may go."
they hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.
it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.
"we should have gotten more than ten points,MR._RON grumbled.
"five, you mean, once she's taken off HERMLONE's."
"good of she to get we out of trouble like that," ronadmitTED.
"mind you, we did save she."
"she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with she,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER reminded ron.
they had reached the portrait of the fat lady.
"pig snout," they said and entered.
the common room was packed and noisy.
everyone was eating the food that had been sent up.
HERMLONE, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for everyone.
there was a very embarrassed pause.
then, none of everyone looking at each other, none of them said "thanks," and hurried off to get plates.
but from that MOMent on, HERMIONE_GRANGER became their friend.
there are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of some things you can't share without ending up liking each other.
chapter eleven.
quidditch.
as they entered november, the weather turned very cold.
the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.
every morning the ground was covered in frost.
hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
the quidditch season had begun.
on saturday, HARRY_POTTER would be playing in HARRY_POTTER first match after weeks of training: GRYFFINDOR versus SLYTHERINS.
if GRYFFINDOR won, GRYFFINDOR would move up into second place in the house championship.
hardly anyone had seen HARRY_POTTER play because WOOD had decided that, as GRYFFINDOR secret weapon, HARRY_POTTER should be kept, well, secret.
but the news that HARRY_POTTER was playing seeker had leaked out somehow, and HARRY_POTTER didn't know which was worse -- people telling HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER'd be brilliant or people telling HARRY_POTTER people'd be running around underneath HARRY_POTTER holding a mattress.
it was really lucky that HARRY_POTTER now had HERMLONE as a friend.
HARRY_POTTER didn't know how HARRY_POTTER'd have gotten through all HARRY_POTTER homework without
, what with all the last-minute quidditch practice WOOD was making what do.
had also tent HARRY_POTTER quidditch through the ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
HARRY_POTTER learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul had happened during a world cup match in 1473; that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul; that although people rarely died playing quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert.
HERMLONE had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since HARRY_POTTER and ron had saved HERMLONE from the mountain troll, and HERMLONE was much nicer for it.
the day before HARRY_POTTER's first quidditch match the three of HARRY_POTTER's first quidditch match  were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and HERMLONE had conjured HARRY_POTTER's first quidditch match  up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
HARRY_POTTER's first quidditch match  were standing with HARRY_POTTER's first quidditch match  backs to it, getting warm, when SNAPE crossed the yard.
HARRY_POTTER noticed at once that SNAPE was limping.
HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE moved closer together to block a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar from view; HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE were sure it wouldn't be allowed.
unfortunately, something about HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE guilty faces caught SNAPE's eye.
SNAPE limped over.
SNAPE hadn't seen a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar, but SNAPE seemed to be looking for a reason to tell HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE off anyway.
"what's that you've got there, POTTER?"
it was quidditch through the ages.
HARRY_POTTER showed HARRY_POTTER.
"library books are not to be taken outside the school," said SNAPE.
"give it to me.
five points from GRYFFINDOR ."
"SNAPE's just made that rule up,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER muttered angrily as SNAPElimped away.
"wonder what's wrong with SNAPE leg?"
"dunno, but i hope it's really hurting SNAPE," said ron bitterly.
the GRYFFINDOR common room was very noisy that evening.
HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE sat together next to a window.
HERMLONE was checking HARRY_POTTER and ron's charms homework for HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE.
HERMLONE would never let HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE copy ("how will you learn?
"), but by asking HERMLONE to read it through, HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE got the right answers anyway.
HARRY_POTTER felt restless.
HARRY_POTTER wanTED quidditch through the ages back, to take HARRY_POTTER mind off HARRY_POTTER nerves about TOMorrow.
why should HARRY_POTTER be afraid of SNAPE?
getting up, HARRY_POTTER told ron, and HERMLONE HARRY_POTTER was going to ask SNAPE if HARRY_POTTER could have it.
"better you than HARRY_POTTER," ron, and HERMLONE said together, but HARRY_POTTER had an idea that SNAPE wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
SNAPE made SNAPE way down to the staffroom and knocked.
there was no answer.
SNAPE knocked again.
nothing.
perhaps SNAPE had left the book in there?
it was worth a try.
SNAPE pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met SNAPE eyes.
SNAPE and FILCH were inside, alone.
SNAPE was holding SNAPE robes above SNAPE knees.
one of SNAPE legs was bloody and mangled.
FILCH was handing SNAPE bandages.
"blasTED thing*,SNAPE SNAPE was saying.
"how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER tried to shut the door quietly, but --
    "POTTER!"
SNAPE's face was twisTED with fury as HARRY_POTTER dropped his robes above his kneesquickly to hide HARRY_POTTER leg.
HARRY_POTTER gulped.
"i just wondered if i could have the book back."
"get out!
out!"
HARRY_POTTER left, before SNAPE could take any more points from GRYFFINDOR.
HARRY_POTTER sprinTED back upstairs.
"did you get it?"
ron asked as HARRY_POTTER joined them.
"what's the matter?"
in a low whisper, HARRY_POTTER told them what HARRY_POTTER'd seen.
"you know what this means?"
HARRY_POTTER finished breathlessly.
"HARRY_POTTER tried to get past that three-headed dog at halloween!
that's where HARRY_POTTER was going when we saw HARRY_POTTER -- HARRY_POTTER's after whatever it's guarding!
and id bet my broomstick HARRY_POTTER let that troll in, to make a diversion!HERMLONE's eyes were wide.
"no -- HARRY_POTTER wouldn't, HERMLONE said.
"i know HARRY_POTTER's not very nice, but HARRY_POTTER wouldn't try and steal something professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was keeping safe."
"honestly, HERMLONE, you think all teachers are saints or something," snapped ron.
"i'm with HARRY_POTTER.
i wouldn't put anything past SNAPE.
but what's SNAPE after?
what's that dog guarding?HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER went to bed with SNAPE head buzzing with the same question.
MR._LONGBOTTOM was snoring loudly, but HARRY_POTTER couldn't sLEE_JORDANp.
HARRY_POTTER tried to empty HARRY_POTTER mind -- HARRY_POTTER needed to sLEE_JORDANp, HARRY_POTTER had to, HARRY_POTTER had HARRY_POTTER first the quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on SNAPE's face when HARRY_POTTER had seen HARRY_POTTER leg wasn't easy to forget.
the next morning dawned very bright and cold.
the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good the quidditch match.
"you've got to eat some breakfast."
"i DON't want anything."
"just a bit of toast," wheedled HERMLONE.
"i'm not hungry.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER felt terrible.
in an hour's time HARRY_POTTER'd be walking onto the field.
"HARRY_POTTER, you need your strength," said SEAMUS_FINNIGAN.
"seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."
"thanks, SEAMUS_FINNIGAN," said HARRY_POTTER, watching SEAMUS_FINNIGAN pile ketchup on HARRY_POTTER sausages.
by eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the the quidditch pitch.
many students had binoculars.
the seats might be raised high in the air, but the seats  was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
ron, and HERMLONE joined MR._LONGBOTTOM, SEAMUS_FINNIGAN, and DEAN_THOMAS the west ham fan up in the top row.
as a surprise for HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE had painTED a large banner on one of the sheets SCABBERS had ruined.
it said POTTER for president, and DEAN_THOMAS, who was good at drawing, had DONe a large GRYFFINDOR lion underneath.
then HERMLONE had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
meanwhile, in the locker room, HARRY_POTTER and the rest of the team were changing into HARRY_POTTER and the rest of the team  scarlet the quidditch robes (SLYTHERINS would be playing in green).
WOOD cleared WOOD throat for silence.
"okay, men," WOOD said.
"and women," said CHASER_ANGELINA_JOHNSON.
"and women," WOOD agreed.
"this is it."
"the big one," said FRED_WEASLEY.
"the one we've all been waiting for," said GEORGE_WEASLEY.
"we know OLIVER_WOOD's speech by heart," FRED_WEASLEY told HARRY_POTTER, "we were on the team  last year."
"shut up, you two," said WOOD.
"this is the best team GRYFFINDOR's had in years.
we're going to win.
i know it."
HARRY_POTTER glared at them all as if to say, "or else."
"right.
it's time.
good luck, all of you.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER followed FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY out of the locker room and, hoping HARRY_POTTER knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
MADAM_HOOCH was refereeing.
MADAM_HOOCH stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, MADAM_HOOCH broom in MADAM_HOOCH hand.
"now, i want a nice fair game, all of you," MADAM_HOOCH said, once they were all gathered around MADAM_HOOCH.
HARRY_POTTER noticed that MADAM_HOOCH seemed to be speaking particularly to the SLYTHERINS captain, MARCUS_FLINT, a sixth year.
HARRY_POTTER thought flint looked as if HARRY_POTTER had some troll blood in HARRY_POTTER.
out of the corner of HARRY_POTTER eye HARRY_POTTER saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing POTTER for president over the crowd.
POTTER for president heart skipped.
POTTER for president felt braver.
"mount your brooms, please.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER clambered onto HARRY_POTTER nimbus two thousand.
MADAM_HOOCH gave a loud blast on MADAM_HOOCH silver whistle.
fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air.
fifteen brooms were off.
"and the quaffle is taken immediately by CHASER_ANGELINA_JOHNSON of GRYFFINDOR -- what an excellent chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --"
    "LEE_JORDAN!"
"sorry, professor."
the weasley twins' friend, LEE_JORDAN, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"and MADAM_HOOCH's really belting along up there, a neat pass to ALICIA_SPINNET, a good find of WOOD, last year only a reserve -- back to CHASER_ANGELINA_JOHNSON and -- no, the SLYTHERINS have taken the quaffle, SLYTHERINS captain MARCUS_FLINT gains the quaffle and off WOOD goes -- flint flying like an eagle up there -- WOOD's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by GRYFFINDOR keeper WOOD and the GRYFFINDORs take the quaffle -- that's CHASER_KATIE_BELL of GRYFFINDOR  there, nice dive around flint, off up the field and -- ouch -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a bludger -- quaffle taken by the SLYTHERINS -- that's ADRIAN_PUCEY speeding off toward the goal posts, but ADRIAN_PUCEY's blocked by a second bludger -- sent ADRIAN_PUCEY way by FRED_WEASLEY or GEORGE_WEASLEY, can't tell which -- nice play by the GRYFFINDOR beater, anyway, and CHASER_ANGELINA_JOHNSON back in possession of the quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, angelina -- keeper BLETCHLEY dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORs score!"
GRYFFINDOR cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the SLYTHERINS.
"budge up there, move along."
"hagrid!"
ron and HERMLONE squeezed together to give "hagrid enough space to join "
    ron and HERMLONE.
"bin watchin' from me hut," said "hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around "hagrid neck, "but it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd.
no sign of the snitch yet, eh?"
"nope," said ron.
"HARRY_POTTER hasn't had much to do yet."
"kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said "hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was HARRY_POTTER.
way up above hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the snitch.
this was part of HARRY_POTTER and WOOD's game plan.
"keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch," WOOD had said.
"we DON't want you attacked before you have to be."
when angelina had scored, HARRY_POTTER had DONe a couple of loop-the-loops to let off HARRY_POTTER feelings.
now HARRY_POTTER was back to staring around for the snitch.
once HARRY_POTTER caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the MRS._WEASLEY' wristwatches, and once a bludger decided to come pelting HARRY_POTTER way, more like a cannonball than anything, but HARRY_POTTER dodged it and FRED_WEASLEY came CHASINg after it.
"all right there, HARRY_POTTER?"
HARRY_POTTER had time to yell, as HARRY_POTTER beat a bludger furiously toward MARCUS_FLINT.
"SLYTHERINS in possession," LEE_JORDAN was saying, "chaser pucey ducks two bludgers, two MRS._WEASLEY, and CHASER_KATIE_BELL, and speeds toward the -- wait a MOMent -- was that the snitchthe snitch?"
a murmur ran through the crowd as ADRIAN_PUCEY dropped the quaffle, too busy looking over ADRIAN_PUCEY shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed ADRIAN_PUCEY left ear.
HARRY_POTTER saw it.
in a great rush of excitement ADRIAN_PUCEY dived downward after the streak of gold.
SLYTHERINS seeker TERENCE_HIGGS had seen SLYTHERINS seeker TERENCE_HIGGS, too.
neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch -all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.
HARRY_POTTER was faster than SLYTHERINS seeker TERENCE_HIGGS -- HARRY_POTTER could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - HARRY_POTTER put on an extra spurt of speed --
    wham!
a roar of rage echoed from the GRYFFINDORs below -- MARCUS_FLINT had blocked HARRY_POTTER on purpose, and HARRY_POTTER's broom spun off course, HARRY_POTTER holding on for dear life.
"foul!"
screamed the GRYFFINDORs.
MADAM_HOOCH spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for GRYFFINDOR.
but in all the confusion, of course, the snitch had disappeared from sight again.
down in the stands, DEAN_THOMAS was yelling, "send DEAN_THOMAS off, ref!
red card!"
"what are you talking about, DEAN_THOMAS?"
said ron.
"red card!"
said DEAN_THOMAS furiously.
"in soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!"
"but this isn't soccer, DEAN_THOMAS," ron reminded DEAN_THOMAS.
hagrid, however, was on DEAN_THOMAS's side.
"they oughta change the rules.
flint coulda knocked HARRY_POTTER outta the air."
LEE_JORDAN was finding it difficult not to take sides.
"so -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
    "LEE_JORDAN!"
growled professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"i mean, after that open and revolting foul
    'LEE_JORDAN, i'm warning you --"
    "all right, all right.
flint nearly kills the GRYFFINDOR seeker, which could happen to anyone, i'm sure, so a penalty to GRYFFINDOR, taken by spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, GRYFFINDOR still in possession."
it was as HARRY_POTTER dodged another bludger, which went spinning dangerously past HARRY_POTTER head, that it happened.
HARRY_POTTER broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.
for a split second, HARRY_POTTER thought HARRY_POTTER was going to fall.
HARRY_POTTER gripped his broom tightly with both HARRY_POTTER hands and knees.
HARRY_POTTER'd never felt anything like that.
it happened again.
it was as though his broom was trying to buck his broom off.
but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck nimbus two thousands riders off.
HARRY_POTTER tried to turn back toward the GRYFFINDOR goal- posts -- HARRY_POTTER had half a mind to ask WOOD to call time-out -- and then HARRY_POTTER realized that his broom was completely out of HARRY_POTTER control.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't turn it.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't direct it at all.
it was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseaTED HARRY_POTTER.
LEE_JORDAN was still commentating.
"SLYTHERINS in possession -- flint with the quaffle -- passes spinnet -- passes CHASER_KATIE_BELL -- hit hard in the face by a bludger, hope it broke HARRY_POTTER nose -- only joking, professor -- SLYTHERINS score -- a no...
    the SLYTHERINS were cheering.
no one seemed to have noticed that HARRY_POTTER's broom was behaving strangely.
HARRY_POTTER's broom was carrying- HARRY_POTTER's broom slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
"dunno what HARRY_POTTER thinks HARRY_POTTER's doing," hagrid mumbled.
HARRY_POTTER stared through his binoculars.
"if i didn' know better, i'd say HARRY_POTTER'd lost control of his broom... but HARRY_POTTER can't have...."
    suddenly, people were pointing up at HARRY_POTTER all over the stands.
his broom had starTED to roll over and over, with HARRY_POTTER only just managing to hold on.
then the crowd gasped.
his broomhad given a wild jerk and HARRY_POTTER swung off his broom.
HARRY_POTTER was now dangling from his broom, holding on with only one hand.
"did something happen to it when flint blocked HARRY_POTTER?"
SEAMUS_FINNIGAN whispered.
"can't have," hagrid said, HARRY_POTTER voice shaking.
"can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic -- no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand."
at these words, HERMLONE seized hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at HARRY_POTTER, HERMLONE starTED looking frantically at the crowd.
"what are you doing?"
moaned ron, gray-faced.
"i knew it,HERMLONE gasped, SNAPE -- look."
ron grabbed his binoculars.
SNAPE was in the middle of the stands opposite them.
SNAPE had SNAPE eyes fixed on HARRY_POTTER and was muttering nonstop under SNAPE breath.
"SNAPE's doing something -- jinxing his broom," said HERMLONE.
"what should we do?"
"leave it to me."
before "
    ron could say another word, HERMLONE had disappeared. "
ronturned his binoculars back on HARRY_POTTER. "
ron was vibrating so hard, his broom was almost impossible for "
    ron to hang on much longer.
the crowd was on the crowd feet, watching, terrified, as the MRS._WEASLEY flew up to try and pull HARRY_POTTER safely onto one of the crowd brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near "
    ron, his broom would jump higher still.
they dropped lower and circled beneath "
    ron, obviously hoping to catch "
    ron if "
    ron fell.
flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
"come on, HERMLONE,"
    ron "
    ron muttered desperately.
HERMLONE had fought HERMLONE way across to the stand where SNAPE stood, and was now racing along the row behind "
    ron; HERMLONE didn't even stop to say sorry as HERMLONE knocked professor QUIRTELL headfirst into the row in front.
reaching SNAPE, HERMLONE crouched down, pulled out HERMLONE wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words.
bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of SNAPE's robes.
it took perhaps thirty seconds for SNAPE to realize that SNAPE was on fire.
a sudden yelp told HERMLONE HERMLONE had DONe HERMLONE job.
scooping fire off SNAPE into a little jar in HERMLONE pocket, HERMLONE scrambled back along the row -- SNAPE would never know what had happened.
it was enough.
up in the air, HARRY_POTTER was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.
"MR._LONGBOTTOM, you can look!"
"
    ron said.
MR._LONGBOTTOM had been sobbing into hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
HARRY_POTTER was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw HARRY_POTTER clap HARRY_POTTER hand to HARRY_POTTER mouth as though HARRY_POTTER was about to be sick -- HARRY_POTTER hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
"i've got the snitch!"
HARRY_POTTER shouTED, waving it above HARRY_POTTER head, and the game ended in complete confusion.
"HARRY_POTTER didn't catch it, HARRY_POTTER nearly swallowed it,flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- HARRY_POTTERhadn't broken any rules and LEE_JORDAN was still happily shouting the results -- GRYFFINDOR had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.
HARRY_POTTER heard none of this, though.
HARRY_POTTER was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid's hut, with ron and HERMLONE.
"it was SNAPE,"
    ron "
    ron was explaining, "HERMLONE and i saw "
    ron. "
ron was cursing your broomstick, muttering, "
    ron wouldn't take "
    ron eyes off "HERMLONE and i."
"rubbish," said hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to LEE_JORDAN in the stands.
"why would SNAPE do somethin' like that?"
HARRY_POTTER, "
    ron, and HERMLONE looked at one another, wondering what to tell LEE_JORDAN.
HARRY_POTTER decided on the truth.
"i found out something about HARRY_POTTER," HARRY_POTTER told hagrid.
"HARRY_POTTER tried to get past that three-headed dog on halloween.
it bit HARRY_POTTER.
we think HARRY_POTTER was trying to steal whatever it's guarding."
hagrid dropped the teapot.
"how do you know about FLUFFY?"
HARRY_POTTER said.
"FLUFFY?"
"yeah -- HARRY_POTTER's mine -- bought HARRY_POTTER off a greek chappie i met in the pub las' year -- i lent HARRY_POTTER to dumbledore to guard the
    "yes?"
said HARRY_POTTER eagerly.
"now, DON't ask me anymore," said hagrid gruffly.
"that's top secret, that is."
"but SNAPE's trying to steal the
    ."
"rubbish," said hagrid again.
"SNAPE's a hogwarts teacher, SNAPE'd do nothin' of the sort."
"so why did SNAPE just try and kill HARRY_POTTER?"
cried HERMLONE.
the afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about SNAPE.
i know a jinx when i see one, hagrid, i've read all about a jinx when i see one, hagrid!
you've got to keep eye contact, and SNAPE wasn't blinking at all, i saw SNAPE!"
"i'm tellin' YEH, yer wrong!"
said hagrid hotly.
"i DON' know why HARRY_POTTER's broom acTED like that, but SNAPE wouldn' try an' kill a student!
now, listen to me, all three of YEH -- yer meddlin' in things that DON' concern YEH.
it's dangerous.
you forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between professor dumbledore an' MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel --"
    "aha!"
said HARRY_POTTER, "so there's someone called MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel involved, is there?"
hagrid looked furious with "
    hagrid.
chapter twelve.
the mirror of erised.
christmas was coming.
one morning in mid-december, hogwarts woke to find hogwarts  covered in several feet of snow.
the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that the weasley twins followed QUIRTELL around, bouncing off the back of QUIRTELL turban.
the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail could fly off again.
no one could wait for the holidays to start.
while GRYFFINDORcommon room and the great hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.
worst of all were professor SNAPE's classes down in the dungeons, where professor SNAPE's classes breath rose in a mist before professor SNAPE's classes and professor SNAPE's classes kept as close as possible to professor SNAPE's classes hot cauldrons.
"i do feel so sorry," said DRACO_MALFOY, one potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas 're not wanTED at home."
he was looking over at HARRY_POTTER as he spoke.
CRABBE and GOYLE chuckled.
HARRY_POTTER, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored HARRY_POTTER, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish.
MALFOY had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match.
disgusTED that the SLYTHERINS had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing HARRY_POTTER as seeker next.
then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way HARRY_POTTER had managed to stay on he bucking broomstick.
so MALFOY, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting HARRY_POTTER about having no proper family.
it was true that HARRY_POTTER wasn't going back to privet drive for christmas.
professor  had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and HARRY_POTTER had signed up at once.
professor  didn't feel sorry for professor  at all; this would probably be the best christmas professor 'd ever had. "
ron and "
    ron brothers were staying, too, because mr. and MRS._WEASLEY were going to romania to visit charlie.
when mr. and MRS._WEASLEY  left the dungeons at the end of potions, mr. and MRS._WEASLEY  found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.
two enormous feet sticking out at the botTOM and a loud puffing sound told mr. and MRS._WEASLEY  that hagrid was behind .
"hi, hagrid, want any help?"
"
    ron asked, sticking "
    ron head through the branches.
"nah, i'm all right, thanks, "
    ron."
"would you mind moving out of the way?"
came MALFOYs cold drawl from behind them.
"are you trying to earn some extra money, weasley?
hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts, i suppose -- that hut of hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to."
ron "
    ron dived at MALFOY just as SNAPE came up the stairs.
"weasley!"
ron "
    ron let go of the front of MALFOY's robes.
". "
ron was provoked, SNAPE," said hagrid, sticking "
    ron huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
"MALFOY was insultin' his family."
"be that as it may, fighting is against hogwarts rules, hagrid," said SNAPE silkily.
"five points from GRYFFINDOR, "weasley, and be grateful it isn't more.
move along, all of you."
MALFOY, CRABBE, and GOYLE pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
"i'll get GOYLE," said "
    ron, grinding "
    ron teeth at MALFOY's back, "one of these days, i'll get GOYLE --"
    "i hate them both," said HARRY_POTTER, "MALFOY and SNAPE."
"come on, cheer up, it's nearly christmas," said hagrid.
"tell YEH what, come with me an' see the great hall, looks a treat."
so the three of them followed hagrid and hagrid tree off to -the great hall, where professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL and professor FLITWICK were busy with the christmas decorations.
"ah, hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"
the hall looked spectacular.
festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.
"how many days you got left until yer holidays?"
hagrid asked.
"just one," said HERMLONE.
"and that reminds me -HARRY_POTTER, "
    ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"oh yeah, you're right," said "
    ron, tearing "
    ron eyes away from professor FLITWICK, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of "
    ron wand and was trailing professor FLITWICK, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand over the branches of the new tree.
"the library?"
said hagrid, following professor FLITWICK, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand out of "
    the hall.
"just before the holidays?
bit keen, aren't YEH?"
"oh, we're not working," HARRY_POTTER told HARRY_POTTER brightly.
"ever since you mentioned MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel we've been trying to find out who HARRY_POTTER is."
"you what?"
hagrid looked shocked.
"listen here -- i've told YEH -- drop it.
it's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
"we just want to know who MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel is, that's all," said HERMLONE.
"unless you'd like to tell we and save we the trouble?"
HARRY_POTTERadded.
"we must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find HARRY_POTTER anywhere -- just give we a hint -- i know i've read HARRY_POTTER name somewhere."
"i'm sayin' nothin, said hagrid flatly.
"just have to find out for we, then," said "
    ron, and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
they had indeed been searching books for flamel's name ever since hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what SNAPE was trying to steal?
the trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel might have DONe to get MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel into a book.
MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel wasn't in great wizards of the twentieth century, or notable magical names of our time; MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel was missing, too, from important modern magical discoveries, and a study of recent developments in wizardry.
and then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
HERMLONE took out a list of subjects and titles HERMLONE had decided to search while "
    ron strode off down a row of books and starTED pulling them off the shelves at random.
HARRY_POTTER wandered over to the restricTED section.
HARRY_POTTER had been wondering for a while if MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel wasn't somewhere in there.
unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricTED books, and HARRY_POTTER knew HARRY_POTTER'd never get one.
these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts.
"what are you looking for, boy?"
"nothing," said HARRY_POTTER.
MADAM_PINCE the librarian brandished a feather duster at a feather duster.
"you'd better get out, then.
go on -- out!"
wishing HARRY_POTTER'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, HARRY_POTTER left the library.
HARRY_POTTER, "
    ron, and HERMLONE had already agreed ron, and HERMLONE'd better not ask MADAM_PINCE where ron, and HERMLONE could find MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel.
ron, and HERMLONE were sure MADAM_PINCE'd be able to tell he, ron, and HERMLONE, but he, ron, and HERMLONE couldn't risk SNAPEhearing what he, ron, and HERMLONE were up to.
HARRY_POTTER waiTED outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but HARRY_POTTER wasn't very hopeful.
he, ron, and HERMLONE had been looking for two weeks, after a, but as he, ron, and HERMLONE only had odd MOMents between lessons it wasn't surprising he, ron, and HERMLONE'd found nothing.
what he, ron, and HERMLONE really needed was a nice long search without MADAM_PINCE breathing down he, ron, and HERMLONE necks.
five minutes later, ron, and HERMLONE joined "
    ron, shaking ron, and HERMLONE heads.
ron, and HERMLONE went off to lunch.
"you will keep looking while i'm away, won't you?"
said HERMLONE.
"and send me an owl if you find anything."
"and you could ask your parents if your parents know who flamel is," said "
    ron.
"it'd be safe to ask ron, and HERMLONE."
"very safe, as ron, and HERMLONE're both dentists," said HERMLONE.
once the holidays had starTED, ron, and HERMLONE were having too good a time to think much about MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel.
ron, and HERMLONE had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so ron, and HERMLONE were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.
ron, and HERMLONE sat by the hour eating anything ron, and HERMLONE could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, english muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting MALFOYexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if ron, and HERMLONE wouldn't work.
    "
ron also starTED teaching HARRY_POTTER wizard chess.
this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. "
ron's set was very old and battered.
like everything else "
    ron owned, ron's set had once belonged to someone else in "
    ron family -- in this case, "
    ron GRANdfather.
however, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. "
ron knew them so well "
    ron never had trouble getting them to do what "
    ron wanTED.
HARRY_POTTER played with chessmen SEAMUS_FINNIGAN had lent HARRY_POTTER, and them didn't trust HARRY_POTTER at all.
HARRY_POTTER wasn't a very good player yet and them kept shouting different bits of advice at HARRY_POTTER, which was confusing.
"DON't send me there, can't you see HARRY_POTTER knight?
send HARRY_POTTER, we can afford to lose HARRY_POTTER."
on christmas eve, HARRY_POTTER went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
when HARRY_POTTER woke early in the morning, however, the first thing HARRY_POTTER saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of bed .
"merry christmas," said "
    ron sLEE_JORDANpily as HARRY_POTTER scrambled out of bed and pulled on "
    ron bathrobe.
"you, too," said HARRY_POTTER.
"will you look at this?
i've got some presents!"
"what did you expect, turnips?"
said "
    ron, turning to "
    ron own pile, which was a lot bigger than HARRY_POTTER's.
HARRY_POTTER picked up the top parcel.
the top parcel was wrapped in thick BROWN paper and scrawled across the top parcel was to HARRY_POTTER, from hagrid.
inside was a roughly cut WOODen flute.
hagrid had obviously whittled it hagrid.
HARRY_POTTER blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.
a second, very small parcel contained a note.
we received your message and enclose your christmas present.
from UNCLE_VERNON and AUNT_PETUNIA.
taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
"that's friendly," said HARRY_POTTER.
    "
ron was fascinaTED by fifty-pence .
"weird!"
"
    ron said, 'nmat a shape!
this is money?"
"you can keep it," said HARRY_POTTER, laughing at how pleased "
    ronwas.
"hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?"
"i think i know who that one's from," said "
    ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
"my MOM.
i told my MOM you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no," "
    ron groaned, "my MOM's made you a "weasley sweater."
HARRY_POTTER had torn open a very lumpy parcel to find a thick, hand-knitTED sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
"every year my MOM makes you a weasley sweater," said "
    ron, unwrapping "
    ron own, "and mine's always maroon."
"that's really nice of my MOM," said HARRY_POTTER, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
HARRY_POTTER next present also contained candy -- a large box of chocolate frogs from HERMLONE.
this only left one parcel.
HARRY_POTTER picked this up and felt this.
this was very light.
HARRY_POTTER unwrapped this.
something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where this lay in gleaming folds. "
ron gasped.
"i've heard of those," "
    ron said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of every flavor beans "
    ron'd gotten from HERMLONE.
"if that's what i think that's  is -- that's 're really rare, and really valuable."
"what is that's ?"
HARRY_POTTER picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.
it was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.
"it's an invisibility clOAK," said ron, a look of awe on his face.
"i'm sure it is -- try it on."
HARRY_POTTER threw the clOAK around HARRY_POTTER shoulders and "
    ron gave a yell.
"it is!
look down!"
HARRY_POTTER looked down at "
    HARRY_POTTER feet, but they were gone. "
HARRY_POTTER dashed to the mirror.
sure enough, "
    HARRY_POTTER reflection looked back at "
    HARRY_POTTER, just "
    HARRY_POTTER head suspended in midair, "
    HARRY_POTTER body completely invisible. "
HARRY_POTTER pulled the clOAK over just his head and his reflection vanished completely.
"there's a note!"
said "
    ron suddenly.
"a note fell out of a note!"
HARRY_POTTER pulled off the clOAK over his head and seized the letter.
written in narrow, loopy writing "
    HARRY_POTTER had never seen before were the following words: your father left this in my possession before your father died.
it is time it was returned to you.
use it well.
a very merry christmas to you.
there was no signature.
HARRY_POTTER stared at the note. "
ron was admiring the clOAK over his head.
"i'd give anything for one of these," "
    ron said.
"anything.
what's the matter?"
"nothing," said HARRY_POTTER. "
ron felt very strange.
who had sent the clOAK over his head?
had the clOAK over his head really once belonged to your father?
before "
    ron could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY bounded in.
HARRY_POTTER stuffed the clOAK over his head quickly out of sight.
HARRY_POTTER didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.
"merry christmas!"
"hey, look -- HARRY_POTTER's got a "weasley sweater, too!"
FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow f on it, the other a g.
    "HARRY_POTTER's is better than ours, though," said FRED_WEASLEY, holding up a weasley sweater.
"she obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
"why aren't you wearing yours, "
    ron?"
GEORGE_WEASLEY demanded.
"come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm."
"i hate maroon," "
    ron moaned halfhearTEDly as "
    ron pulled it over "
    ron head.
"you haven't got a letter on yours," GEORGE_WEASLEY observed.
"i suppose she thinks you DON't forget your name.
but we're not stupid -- we know we're called GRED and forge."
"what's all th is noise.
"weasley stuck just his head through the dormitory door , looking disapproving.
"weasley had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping "weasley presents as "weasley, too, carried a lumpy sweater over "weasley arm, which
    FRED_WEASLEY seized.
"p for prefect!
get p for prefect on, PERCY_WEASLEY, come on, we're all wearing we, HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER got one."
"i -- DON't -- want said PERCY_WEASLEY thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over PERCY_WEASLEY , knocking PERCY_WEASLEY glasses askew.
"and you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said
    GEORGE_WEASLEY.
"merry christmas is a time for family."
they frog-marched PERCY_WEASLEY from the room, they frog-marched PERCY_WEASLEY from the room arms pinned to they frog-marched PERCY_WEASLEY from the room side by they frog-marched PERCY_WEASLEY from the room sweater.
HARRY_POTTER had never in all HARRY_POTTER life had such a christmas dinner.
a hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table.
these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the DURSLEYS usually bought, with these fantastic party favors little plastic toys and these fantastic party favors flimsy paper hats inside.
HARRY_POTTER pulled a wizard cracker with FRED_WEASLEY and a wizard cracker didn't just bang, a wizard cracker went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice.
up at the high table, dumbledore had swapped dumbledore poinTED wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor FLITWICK had just read professor FLITWICK.
flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey.
PERCY_WEASLEY nearly broke PERCY_WEASLEY teeth on a silver sickle embedded in PERCY_WEASLEY slice. "
HARRY_POTTERwatched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as "
    HARRY_POTTER called for more wine, finally kissing professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL on the cheek, who, to HARRY_POTTER's amazement, giggled and blushed, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL top hat lopsided.
when HARRY_POTTER finally left the table, HARRY_POTTER was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a grow-your-own-warts kit, and HARRY_POTTER own new wizard chess set.
the white mice had disappeared and HARRY_POTTER had a nasty feeling the white mice were going to end up as mrs. NORRIS's christmas dinner.
HARRY_POTTER and the MRS._WEASLEY spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.
then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, HARRY_POTTER and the MRS._WEASLEY returned to the fire in the GRYFFINDOR common room, where HARRY_POTTER broke in HARRY_POTTER new chess set by losing spectacularly to"
    ron"
    ron.
HARRY_POTTER suspecTED HARRY_POTTER wouldn't have lost so badly if PERCY_WEASLEY hadn't tried to help HARRY_POTTER so much.
after a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sLEE_JORDANpy to do much before bed except sit and watch PERCY_WEASLEY chase FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY all over GRYFFINDOR tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.
it had been HARRY_POTTER's best christmas day ever.
yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind HARRY_POTTER's best christmas day ever.
not until his climbed into bed was his free to think about not until he climbed into bed: the invisibility clOAK and whoever had sent not until he climbed into bed.
    "
ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother his, fell asLEE_JORDANp almost as soon as his'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster.
HARRY_POTTER leaned over the side of HARRY_POTTER own bed and pulled the clOAK over his head out from under the clOAK over his head.
your father's... this had been your father's.
HARRY_POTTER let the material flow over HARRY_POTTER hands, smoother than silk, light as air.
use the material  well, the note had said.
HARRY_POTTER had to try the material , now.
HARRY_POTTER slipped out of bed and wrapped the clOAK over his head.
looking down at HARRY_POTTER legs, HARRY_POTTER saw only moonlight and shadows.
it was a very funny feeling.
use it well.
suddenly, HARRY_POTTER felt wide-awake.
the whole of hogwarts was open to HARRY_POTTER in the clOAK over his head.
excitement flooded through HARRY_POTTER as HARRY_POTTER stood there in the dark and silence.
HARRY_POTTER could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and FILCH would never know.
    "
ron grunTED in "
    ron sLEE_JORDANp.
should HARRY_POTTER wake HARRY_POTTER?
something held HARRY_POTTER back -- your father-- HARRY_POTTER felt that this time -- the first time -- HARRY_POTTER wanTED to use it alone.
HARRY_POTTER crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.
"who's there?"
squawked the fat lady.
HARRY_POTTER said nothing.
HARRY_POTTER walked quickly down the corridor.
where should HARRY_POTTER go?
HARRY_POTTER stopped, HARRY_POTTER heart racing, and thought.
and then it came to HARRY_POTTER.
the restricTED section in the library.
HARRY_POTTER'd be able to read as long as HARRY_POTTER liked, as long as the restricTED section in the library took to find out who flamel was.
HARRY_POTTER set off, drawing the invisibility clOAK tight around HARRY_POTTER as HARRY_POTTER walked.
the library was pitch-black and very eerie.
HARRY_POTTER lit a lamp to see HARRY_POTTER way along the rows of books.
a lamp  looked as if a lamp
was floating along in midair, and even though HARRY_POTTER could feel HARRY_POTTER arm supporting a lamp , the sight gave HARRY_POTTER the creeps.
the restricTED section was right at the back of the library.
step ping carefully over the rope that separaTED these books from the rest of the library, HARRY_POTTER held up a lamp  to read the titles.
they didn't tell HARRY_POTTER much.
they peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages HARRY_POTTER couldn't understand.
some had no title at all.
one book had a dark stain on one book that looked horribly like blood.
the hairs on the back of HARRY_POTTER's neck prickled.
maybe HARRY_POTTER was imagining it, maybe not, but HARRY_POTTER thought a faint whispering was coming from these books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
HARRY_POTTER had to start somewhere.
setting a lamp  down carefully on the floor, HARRY_POTTER looked along the botTOM shelf for an interestinglooking book.
a large black and silver volume caught HARRY_POTTER eye.
HARRY_POTTER pulled his eye out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it
on HARRY_POTTER knee, let it  fall open.
a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- one bookwas screaming!
HARRY_POTTER snapped one book shut, but bloodcurdling shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.
HARRY_POTTER stumbled backward and knocked over HARRY_POTTER lamp, which went out at once.
paNICKing, HARRY_POTTER heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing one book back on the botTOM shelf, HARRY_POTTER ran for one book.
HARRY_POTTER passed FILCH in the doorway; FILCH's pale, wild eyes looked straight through HARRY_POTTER, and HARRY_POTTER slipped under FILCH's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, an interestinglooking book's shrieks still ringing in HARRY_POTTER ears.
HARRY_POTTER came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.
HARRY_POTTER had been so busy getting away from the library, HARRY_POTTER hadn't paid attention to where HARRY_POTTER was going.
perhaps because it was dark, HARRY_POTTER didn't recognize where HARRY_POTTER was at all.
there was a suit of armor near the kitchens, HARRY_POTTER knew, but HARRY_POTTER must be five floors above there.
"you asked me to come directly to professor, professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library restricTED section."
HARRY_POTTER felt the blood drain out of HARRY_POTTER face.
wherever HARRY_POTTER was, FILCH must know a shortcut, because HARRY_POTTER soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to HARRY_POTTER horror, it was SNAPE who replied, "the restricTED section?
well, his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was SNAPE who replied, "the restricTED section can't be far, we'll catch his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was SNAPE who replied, "the restricTED section."
HARRY_POTTER stood rooTED to the spot as FILCH and SNAPE came around the corner ahead.
FILCH and SNAPE couldn't see "
    HARRY_POTTER, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if FILCH and SNAPE came much nearer FILCH and SNAPE'd knock right into "
    HARRY_POTTER -- the clOAK over his head didn't stop "
    HARRY_POTTER from being solid.
    "
HARRY_POTTER backed away as quietly as "
    HARRY_POTTER could.
a door stood ajar to "
    HARRY_POTTER left.
it was "
    HARRY_POTTER only hope. "
HARRY_POTTER squeezed through it, holding "
    HARRY_POTTER breath, trying not to move it, and to "
    HARRY_POTTER relief "
    HARRY_POTTER managed to get inside the room without his relief noticing anything.
his relief walked straight past, and HARRY_POTTER leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to his relief footsteps dying away.
that had been close, very close.
it was a few seconds before HARRY_POTTER noticed anything about the room HARRY_POTTER had hidden in.
it looked like an unused classroom.
the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall was something that didn't look as if an upturned wastepaper basket belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put an upturned wastepaper basket there to keep an upturned wastepaper basket out of the way.
it was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
there was an inscription carved around the top: erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi panic fading now that there was no sound of FILCH and SNAPE, HARRY_POTTER moved nearer to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet, wanting to look at erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi but see no reflection again.
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi stepped in front of it.
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi had to clap erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi to erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi mouth to stop erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi from screaming.
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi whirled around.
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi had seen not only erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
but the room was empty.
breathing very fast, erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi turned slowly back to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
there erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi was, reflecTED in the room, white and scared-looking, and there, reflecTED behind erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi, were at least ten others.
HARRY_POTTER looked over HARRY_POTTER shoulder -- but still, no one was there.
or were they all invisible, too?
was erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi in fact in a room full of invisible people and a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet's trick was that a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet reflecTED them, invisible or not?
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi looked in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet again.
a woman standing right behind erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi reflection was smiling at erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi and waving.
erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi reached out a hand and felt the air behind erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
if a woman standing right behind his reflection was really there, erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi'd touch a woman standing right behind his reflection, their reflections were so close together, but erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi felt only air -- a woman standing right behind his reflection and the others exisTED only in a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
a woman standing right behind his reflection was a very pretty woman.
a woman standing right behind his reflection had dark red hair and a woman standing right behind his reflection eyes -- a woman standing right behind his reflection eyes are just like mine, HARRY_POTTER thought, edging a little closer to the glass.
bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then HARRY_POTTER noticed that a woman standing right behind his reflection was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.
the tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to a woman standing right behind his reflection put HARRY_POTTER arm around a woman standing right behind his reflection.
HARRY_POTTER wore glasses, and HARRY_POTTER hair was very untidy.
it stuck up at the back, just as HARRY_POTTER's did.
HARRY_POTTER was so close to the mirror now that HARRY_POTTER nose was nearly touching that of HARRY_POTTER reflection.
"MOM?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"dad?"
they just looked at HARRY_POTTER, smiling.
and slowly, HARRY_POTTER looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like HARRY_POTTER, other noses like HARRY_POTTER, even a little old man who looked as though HARRY_POTTER had HARRY_POTTER's knobbly knees -- HARRY_POTTER was looking at HARRY_POTTER family, for the first time in HARRY_POTTER life.
the POTTERs smiled and waved at HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER stared hungrily back at the POTTERs, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though HARRY_POTTER was hoping to fall right through the glass and reach the POTTERs.
HARRY_POTTER had a powerful kind of ache inside HARRY_POTTER, half joy, half terrible sadness.
how long HARRY_POTTER stood there, HARRY_POTTER didn't know.
the reflections did not fade and HARRY_POTTER looked and looked until a distant noise brought HARRY_POTTER back to HARRY_POTTER senses.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't stay here, HARRY_POTTER had to find HARRY_POTTER way back to bed.
HARRY_POTTER tore HARRY_POTTER eyes away from HARRY_POTTER MOTHER's face, whispered, "i'll come back," and hurried from the room.
"you could have woken me up," said "
    ron, crossly.
"you can come tonight, i'm going back, i want to show you the mirror.
"i'd like to see your MOM and dad," "
    ron said eagerly.
"and i want to see all your family, all the MRS._WEASLEY, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone."
"you can see your other brothers and everyone any old time," said "
    ron.
"just come round my house this summer.
anyway, maybe my house only shows dead people.
shame about not finding flamel, though.
have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?"
HARRY_POTTER couldn't eat.
HARRY_POTTER had seen HARRY_POTTER parents and would be seeing his parents again tonight.
HARRY_POTTER had almost forgotten about flamel.
it didn't seem very important anymore.
who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?
what did it matter if SNAPE stole it, really?
"are you all right?"
said "
    ron.
"you look odd."
what HARRY_POTTER feared most was that HARRY_POTTER might not be able to find the mirror room again.
with "
    ron covered in the clOAK, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.
they tried retracing HARRY_POTTER's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
"i'm freezing," said "
    ron.
"let's forget it and go back."
"no!"
HARRY_POTTER hissed.
i know it's here somewhere."
they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.
just as "
    ron starTED moaning that "
    ron feet were dead with cold, HARRY_POTTER spotTED the suit of armor.
"it's here -- just here -- yes!"
they pushed the door open.
HARRY_POTTER dropped the clOAK from around HARRY_POTTER shoulders and ran to a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
there they were.
HARRY_POTTER MOTHER and father beamed at the sight of HARRY_POTTER.
"see?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"i can't see anything."
"look!
look at them all... there are loads of them...."
    "i can only see you."
"look in it properly, go on, stand where i am."
HARRY_POTTER stepped aside, but with "
    ron in front of a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet, "
    ron couldn't see his family anymore, just "
    ron in "
    ron paisley pajamas.
    "
ron, though, was staring transfixed at "
    ron image.
"look at "
    ron!"
"
    ron said.
"can you see his family standing around you?"
"no -- i'm alone -- but i'm different -- i look older -- and i'm head boy!"
"what?"
"i am -- i'm wearing the badge like BILL used to -- and i'm holding the house cup and the quidditch cup -- i'm quidditch captain, too.
    "
ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look exciTEDly at HARRY_POTTER.
"do you think a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet shows the future?"
"how can a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet?
his family are dead -- let me have another look --"
    "you had a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
"you're only holding the quidditch cup, what's interesting about that?
i want to see my parents."
"DON't push me --"
    a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
their hadn't realized how loudly their had been talking.
"quick!"
"
    ron threw the clOAK back over their as his eyes came round the door. "
ron and HARRY_POTTER stood quite still, ron and HARRY_POTTER thinking the same thing -- did the the clOAK work on cats?
after what seemed an age, she turned and left.
"this isn't safe -- she might have gone for FILCH, i bet she heard us.
come on."
and "
    ron pulled HARRY_POTTER out of the room.
the snow still hadn't melTED the next morning.
"want to play chess, HARRY_POTTER?"
said "
    ron.
"no."
"why DON't us go down and visit hagrid?"
"no... you go..."
    "i know what you're thinking about, HARRY_POTTER, that mirror.
DON't go back tonight."
"why not?"
"i dunno, i've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already.
FILCH, SNAPE, and mrs. NORRIS are wandering around.
so what if FILCH, SNAPE, and mrs. NORRIS can't see you?
what if FILCH, SNAPE, and mrs. NORRIS walk into you?
what if you knock something over?"
"you sound like HERMLONE."
"i'm serious, HARRY_POTTER, DON't go."
but HARRY_POTTER only had one thought in HARRY_POTTER head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and "
    ron wasn't going to stop HARRY_POTTER.
that third night "
    ron found "
    ron way more quickly than before. "
ron was walking so fast "
    ron knew "
    ron was making more noise than was wise, but "
    ron didn't meet anyone.
and there were "
    ron MOTHER and father smiling at "
    ron again, and one of "
    ron GRANdfathers nodding happily.
HARRY_POTTER sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.
there was nothing to stop "
    ron from staying here all night with his family.
nothing at all.
except --
    "so -- back again, HARRY_POTTER?"
HARRY_POTTER felt as though HARRY_POTTER insides had turned to ice.
HARRY_POTTER looked behind HARRY_POTTER.
sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
HARRY_POTTER must have walked straight past HARRY_POTTER, so desperate to get to the mirror HARRY_POTTER hadn't noticed HARRY_POTTER.
    "
-- i didn't see you, sir."
"strange how nearsighTED being invisible can make you," said dumbledore, and HARRY_POTTER was relieved to see that HARRY_POTTER was smiling.
"so," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with HARRY_POTTER, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised."
"i didn't know it was called that, sir."
"but i expect you've realized by now what it does?"
"it -- well -- it shows me my family --"
    "and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy."
"how did you know --?"
"i DON't need a clOAK to become invisible," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE gently.
"now, can you think what the mirror of erised erised shows us all?"
HARRY_POTTER shook HARRY_POTTER head.
"let me explain.
the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised erised like a normal mirror, that is, the happiest man on earth would look into the mirror of erised and see the happiest man on earth exactly as the happiest man on earth is.
does that help?"
HARRY_POTTER thought.
then the happiest man on earth said slowly, "it shows us what us want... whatever us want..."
    "yes and no," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE quietly.
"it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of us hearts.
you, who have never known your family, see your family standing around your family.
RONALD_WEASLEY, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees his standing alone, the best of all of RONALD_WEASLEY, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers.
however, the mirror of erised will give us neither knowledge or truth.
men have wasTED away before the mirror of erised, entranced by what men have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what the mirror of erised shows is real or even possible.
"the mirror of erised will be moved to a new home TOMorrow, HARRY_POTTER, and i ask you not to go looking for the mirror of erised again.
if you ever do run across the mirror of erised, you will now be prepared.
the mirror of erised does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
now, why DON't you put that admirable clOAK back on and get off to bed?"
HARRY_POTTER stood up.
"sir -- professor dumbledore?
can i ask you something?"
"obviously, you've just DONe so,ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE smiled.
"you may ask me one more thing, however."
"what do you see when you look in the mirror of erised?"
"i?
i see sir -- professor dumbledore holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
HARRY_POTTER stared.
"one can never have enough socks," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"another christmas has come and gone and i didn't get a single pair.
people will insist on giving me books."
it was only when ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was back in bed that it struck HARRY_POTTER that ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE might not have been quite truthful.
but then, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE thought, as ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE shoved SCABBERS off ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
chapter thirteen.
MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE had convinced HARRY_POTTER not to go looking for the mirror of erised again, and for the rest of the christmas holidays the clOAK stayed folded at the botTOM of ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE trunk.
HARRY_POTTERwished HARRY_POTTER could forget what HARRY_POTTER'd seen in the mirror of erised as easily, but HARRY_POTTER couldn't.
HARRY_POTTER starTED having nightmares.
over and over again HARRY_POTTER dreamed about HARRY_POTTER parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
"you see, ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was right, the mirror of erised could drive you mad," said "
    ron, when HARRY_POTTER told ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE about these drearns.
HERMLONE, who came back the day before term starTED, took a different view of things.
she was torn between horror at the idea of HARRY_POTTER being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("if FILCH had caught you!
"), and disappointment that FILCH hadn't at least found out who MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel was.
they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li- brary book, even though HARRY_POTTER was still sure HARRY_POTTER'd read the name somewhere.
once term had starTED, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during they breaks.
HARRY_POTTER had even less time than the other two, because quidditch practice had starTED again.
WOOD was working the team harder than ever.
even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.
the MRS._WEASLEY complained that WOOD was becoming a fanatic, but HARRY_POTTER was on WOOD's side.
if they won they next match, against HUFFLEPUFFS, they would overtake SLYTHERINS in the house championship for the first time in seven years.
quite apart from wanting to win, HARRY_POTTER found that HARRY_POTTER had fewer nightmares when HARRY_POTTER was tired out after training.
then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, WOOD gave the team a bit of bad news.
HARRY_POTTER'd just gotten very angry with the MRS._WEASLEY, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.
"will you stop messing around!"
HARRY_POTTER yelled.
"that's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match!
SNAPE's refereeing this time, and HARRY_POTTER'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off GRYFFINDOR!"
GEORGE_WEASLEY really did fall off "
    GEORGE_WEASLEY broom at these words.
"SNAPE's refereeing?"
SNAPE spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
"when's SNAPE ever refereed a quidditch match?
SNAPE's not going to be fair if we might overtake SLYTHERINS."
the rest of the team landed next to GEORGE_WEASLEY to complain, too.
"it's not my fault," said WOOD.
"we've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so SNAPE hasn't got an excuse to pick on we."
which was all very well, thought HARRY_POTTER, but HARRY_POTTER had another reason for not wanting SNAPE near HARRY_POTTER while HARRY_POTTER was playing quidditch....
the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but HARRY_POTTER headed straight back to the GRYFFINDOR common room, where HARRY_POTTER found "
    ron and HERMLONE playing chess.
chess was the only thing HERMLONE ever lost at, something HARRY_POTTER and "
    ron thought was very good for her.
"DON't talk to chess for a MOMent," said "
    ron when HARRY_POTTER sat down next to HARRY_POTTER, "i need to concen --" HARRY_POTTER caught sight of HARRY_POTTER's face.
"what's the matter with HARRY_POTTER?
you look terrible."
speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, HARRY_POTTER told the other two about SNAPE's sudden, sinister desire to be a quidditch referee.
"DON't play," said HERMLONE at once.
"say you're ill," said "
    ron.
"pretend to break your leg," HERMLONE suggesTED.
"really break your leg," said "
    ron.
"i can't," said HARRY_POTTER.
"there isn't a reserve seeker.
if i back out, GRYFFINDOR can't play at all."
at that MOMent MR._LONGBOTTOM toppled into the common room.
how MR._LONGBOTTOM had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because MR._LONGBOTTOM legs had been stuck together with what anyone's guess,  recognized at once as the leg-locker curse.
MR._LONGBOTTOM must have had to bunny hop all the way up to GRYFFINDOR tower.
everyone fell over laughing except HERMLONE, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.
MR._LONGBOTTOM's legs sprang apart and MR._LONGBOTTOM got to MR._LONGBOTTOM feet, trembling.
"what happened?"
HERMLONE asked MR._LONGBOTTOM, leading MR._LONGBOTTOM over to sit with HARRY_POTTER and ron.
"MALFOY," said MR._LONGBOTTOM shakily.
"i met MR._LONGBOTTOM outside the library.
MR._LONGBOTTOM said MR._LONGBOTTOM'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
"go to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL!"
HERMLONE urged MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"report MR._LONGBOTTOM!"
MR._LONGBOTTOM shook "
    MR._LONGBOTTOM head.
"i DON't want more trouble," MR._LONGBOTTOM mumbled.
"you've got to stand up to MR._LONGBOTTOM, MR._LONGBOTTOM!"
said "
    ron.
"MR._LONGBOTTOM's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of MR._LONGBOTTOM and make it easier."
"there's no need to tell me i'm not brave enough to be in GRYFFINDOR, MALFOY's already DONe that," MR._LONGBOTTOM choked out.
HARRY_POTTER felt in the pocket of HARRY_POTTER robes and pulled out a chocolate frog, the very last one from the box HERMLONE had GIVEN_HARRY for christmas.
HARRY_POTTER gave a chocolate frog, the very last one from the box HERMLONE had given him for christmas to MR._LONGBOTTOM, who looked as though HARRY_POTTER might cry.
"you're worth twelve of MALFOY," HARRY_POTTER said.
"the sorting hat chose you for GRYFFINDOR, didn't the sorting hat?
and where's MALFOY?
in stinking SLYTHERINS."
MR._LONGBOTTOM's lips twitched in a weak smile as "
    MR._LONGBOTTOM's lips unwrapped the frog.
"thanks, HARRY_POTTER...
i think i'll go to bed.... d'you want the card, you collect the card, DON't you?"
as MR._LONGBOTTOM walked away, HARRY_POTTER looked at the card.
"dumbledore again," HARRY_POTTER said, "HARRY_POTTER was the first one i ever-"
    HARRY_POTTER gasped.
HARRY_POTTER stared at the back of the card.
then HARRY_POTTER looked up at ron and HERMLONE.
"i've found HARRY_POTTER!"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"i've found flamel!
i told you i'd read the name somewhere before, i read the name on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE is particularly famous for ALBUS_DUMBLEDOREdefeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE work on alchemy with ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE partner, MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel'!"
HERMLONE jumped to "
    HERMLONE feet. "
HERMLONE hadn't looked so exciTED since they'd gotten back the marks for they very first piece of homework.
"stay there!"
"
    HERMLONE said, and "
    HERMLONE sprinTED up the stairs to the girls' dormitories.
HARRY_POTTER and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before "
    HERMLONE was dashing back, an enormous old book in "
    HERMLONE arms.
"i never thought to look in here!"
"
    HERMLONE whispered exciTEDly.
"i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"light?"
said "
    ron, but HERMLONE told "
    ron to be quiet until "
    HERMLONE'd looked something up, and starTED flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to "
    HERMLONE.
at last "
    HERMLONE found what "
    HERMLONE was looking for.
"i knew it!
i knew it!"
"are we allowed to speak yet?"
said "
    ron grumpily.
HERMLONEignored "
    ron.
"MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel'," "
    HERMLONE whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone!"
this didn't have quite the effect "
    HERMLONE'd expecTED.
"the what?"
said HARRY_POTTER and ron.
"oh, honestly, DON't you two read?
look -- read that, there."
"
    HERMLONE pushed an enormous old book in her arms toward HARRY_POTTER and ron, and HARRY_POTTER and ron read: the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer's stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
the sorcerer's stone will transform any metal into pure gold.
the sorcerer's stone also produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal.
there have been many reports of the sorcerer's stone over the centuries, but the only stone currently in existence belongs to MR._DUMBLEDORE, the noTED alchemist and opera lover.
MR._DUMBLEDORE, the noTED alchemist and opera loverenjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife, PERENELLE (six hundred and fifty-eight).
"see?"
said HERMLONE, when HARRY_POTTER and ron had finished.
"the dog must be guarding flamel's sorcerer's stone!
i bet the dog  asked ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE to keep the dog  safe for the dog , because they're friends and the dog  knew someone was after it, that's why the dog  wanTED the sorcerer's stone moved out of GRINGOTTS!"
"a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"no wonder SNAPE's after it!
anyone would want it."
"and no wonder we couldn't find MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel' in that study of recent developments in wizardry," said "
    ron.
". "
ron's not exactly recent if "
    ron's six hundred and sixty-five, is "
    ron?"
the next morning in defense against the dark arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, HARRY_POTTER and ron were still discussing what HARRY_POTTER and ron'd do with the sorcerer's stone if HARRY_POTTER and ron had one.
it wasn't until "
    ron said "
    ron'd buy "
    ron own quidditch team that HARRY_POTTER remembered about SNAPE and the coming match.
"i'm going to play," SNAPE told ron and HERMLONE.
"if i DON't, all the SLYTHERINS will think i'm just too scared to face SNAPE.
i'll show all the SLYTHERINS... it'll really wipe the smiles off all the SLYTHERINS faces if we win."
"just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said HERMLONE.
as the match drew nearer, however, HARRY_POTTER became more and more nervous, whatever HARRY_POTTER told ron and HERMLONE.
the rest of the team wasn't too calm, either.
the idea of overtaking SLYTHERINS in the house championship was wonderful, no one had DONe it for seven years, but would ron and HERMLONE be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
HARRY_POTTER didn't know whether HARRY_POTTER was imagining it or not, but HARRY_POTTER seemed to keep running into SNAPE wherever HARRY_POTTER went.
at times, HARRY_POTTER even wondered whether SNAPE was following HARRY_POTTER, trying to catch HARRY_POTTER on HARRY_POTTER own.
potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, SNAPE was so horrible to HARRY_POTTER.
could SNAPE possibly know they'd found out about the sorcerer's stone?
HARRY_POTTER didn't see how HARRY_POTTER could -- yet HARRY_POTTER sometimes had the horrible feeling that SNAPEcould read minds.
HARRY_POTTER knew, when they wished HARRY_POTTER good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that ron and HERMLONE were wondering whether ron and HERMLONE'd ever see HARRY_POTTER alive again.
this wasn't what you'd call comforting.
HARRY_POTTER hardly heard a word of WOOD's pep talk as HARRY_POTTER pulled on his robes and picked up HARRY_POTTER nimbus two thousand.
ron and HERMLONE, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to MR._LONGBOTTOM, who couldn't understand why ron and HERMLONE looked so grim and worried, or why ron and HERMLONE had ron and HERMLONE brought ron and HERMLONE wands to the match.
little did HARRY_POTTER know that ron and HERMLONE had been secretly practicing the leg-locker curse.
ron and HERMLONE'd gotten the idea from MALFOY using it on MR._LONGBOTTOM, and were ready to use it on SNAPE if SNAPE showed any sign of wanting to hurt HARRY_POTTER.
"now, DON't forget, it's locomotor mortis,"
    HERMLONE muttered as "
    ron slipped "
    ron wand up "
    ron sLEE_JORDANve.
"i know," "
    ron snapped.
"DON't nag."
back in the locker room, WOOD had taken HARRY_POTTER aside.
"DON't want to pressure you, POTTER, but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it's now.
finish the game before SNAPEcan favor HUFFLEPUFFS too much."
"the whole school's out there!"
said FRED_WEASLEY, peering out of the door.
"even -- blimey -- ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's come to watch!"
HARRY_POTTER's heart did a somersault.
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE?"
ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE said, dashing to the door to make sure.
FRED_WEASLEY was right.
there was no mistaking that silver beard.
HARRY_POTTER could have laughed out loud with relief HARRY_POTTER was safe.
there was simply no way that SNAPE would dare to try to hurt HARRY_POTTER if ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE was watching.
perhaps that was why SNAPE was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that "
    ron noticed, too.
"i've never seen SNAPE look so mean," SNAPE told HERMLONE.
"look -they're off ouch!"
someone had poked "
    ron in the back of the head.
it was MALFOY.
"oh, sorry, FRED_WEASLEY, didn't see you there."
MALFOY grinned broadly at CRABBE and GOYLE.
"wonder how long POTTER's going to stay on POTTER broom this time?
anyone want a bet?
what about you, FRED_WEASLEY?"
"
    ron didn't answer; SNAPE had just awarded HUFFLEPUFFS a penalty because GEORGE_WEASLEY had hit a bludger at GEORGE_WEASLEY.
HERMLONE, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at HARRY_POTTER, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the snitch.
"you know how i think they choose people for the GRYFFINDOR team?"
said "
    MALFOY loudly a few minutes later, as SNAPE awarded HUFFLEPUFFS another penalty for no reason at all.
"it's people people  feel sorry for.
see, there's POTTER, who's got no parents, then there's the MRS._WEASLEY, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, longbotTOM, you've got no brains."
MR._LONGBOTTOM went bright red but turned in his seat to face "
    MALFOY.
"i'm worth twelve of you, "
    MALFOY," he stammered.
MALFOY, CRABBE, and GOYLE howled with laughter, but "
    ron, still not daring to take "
    ron eyes from the game, said, "you tell "
    ron, MR._LONGBOTTOM."
"longbotTOM, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than FRED_WEASLEY, and that's saying something."
ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about HARRY_POTTER.
"i'm warning you, MALFOY -- one more word
    ". "
ron!"
said HERMLONE suddenly, "HARRY_POTTER --"
    "what?
where?"
HARRY_POTTER had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.
HERMLONE stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as HARRY_POTTER streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
"you're in luck, FRED_WEASLEY, POTTER's obviously spotTED some money on the ground!"
said "
    MALFOY.
    "
ron snapped.
before "
    MALFOY knew what was happening, "
    ron was on top of "
    ron, wrestling "
    ron to the ground.
MR._LONGBOTTOM hesitaTED, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
"come on, HARRY_POTTER!"
HERMLONE screamed, leaping onto his seat to watch as HARRY_POTTER sped straight at SNAPE -- her didn't even notice "
    MALFOY and "
    ron rolling around under her , or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was MR._LONGBOTTOM, CRABBE, and GOYLE.
up in the air, SNAPE turned on SNAPE broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past SNAPE, missing SNAPE by inches -- the next second, HARRY_POTTER had pulled out of the dive, HARRY_POTTER arm raised in triumph, the snitch clasped in HARRY_POTTER hand.
the stands erupTED; the stands had to be a record, no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly.
". "
ron! "
ron!
where are you?
the game's over!
HARRY_POTTER's won!
we've won!
GRYFFINDOR is in the lead!"
shrieked HERMLONE, dancing up and down on GRYFFINDOR and hugging PARVATI_PATIL in the row in front.
HARRY_POTTER jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't believe it.
HARRY_POTTER'd DONe it -- the game was over; the game had barely lasTED five minutes.
as GRYFFINDORs came spilling onto the field, HARRY_POTTER saw SNAPE land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then HARRY_POTTER felt a hand on HARRY_POTTER shoulder and looked up into ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE's smiling face.
"well DONe," said ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE quietly, so that HARRY_POTTERcould hear.
"nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..."
    SNAPE spat bitterly on the ground.
HARRY_POTTER left the locker room alone some time later, to take HARRY_POTTER nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't ever remember feeling happier.
HARRY_POTTER'd really DONe something to be proud of now -- no one could say HARRY_POTTER was just a famous name any more.
the evening air had never smelled so sweet.
HARRY_POTTER walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in HARRY_POTTER head, which was a happy blur: GRYFFINDORs running to lift HARRY_POTTER onto their shoulders; "
    ron and HERMLONE in the distance, jumping up and down, "
    ron cheering through a heavy nosebLEE_JORDANd.
HARRY_POTTER had reached the shed.
HARRY_POTTER leaned against the WOODen door and looked up at hogwarts, with the WOODen door windows glowing red in the setting sun.
GRYFFINDOR in the lead.
HARRY_POTTER'd DONe it, HARRY_POTTER'd shown SNAPE....
    and speaking of SNAPE...
    a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.
clearly not wanting to be seen, a hooded figure walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.
HARRY_POTTER's victory faded from HARRY_POTTER mind as HARRY_POTTER watched.
HARRY_POTTER recognized a hooded figure's prowling walk.
SNAPE, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
HARRY_POTTER jumped back on HARRY_POTTER nimbus two thousand and took off.
gliding silently over the castle HARRY_POTTER saw SNAPE enter the forest at a run.
HARRY_POTTER followed.
the trees were so thick HARRY_POTTER couldn't see where SNAPE had gone.
SNAPEflew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until HARRY_POTTER heard voices.
HARRY_POTTER glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.
HARRY_POTTER climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
below, in a shadowy clearing, stood SNAPE, but SNAPE wasn't alone.
QUIRTELL was there, too.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't make out the look on HARRY_POTTER face, but HARRY_POTTER was stuttering worse than ever.
HARRY_POTTER strained to catch what they were saying.
"... d-DON't know why you wanTED t-t-to meet here of all p-places, SEVERUS_SNAPE..."
    "oh, i thought we'd keep this private," said SNAPE, SNAPE voice icy.
"students aren't supposed to know about the sorcerer's stone, after all."
HARRY_POTTER leaned forward.
QUIRTELL was mumbling something.
SNAPE interrupTED QUIRTELL.
"have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid's yet?"
"b-b-but SEVERUS_SNAPE, i --"
    "you DON't want me as your enemy, QUIRTELL," said SNAPE, taking a step toward SNAPE.
"i-i DON't know what you
    "you know perfectly well what i mean."
an owl hooTED loudly, and HARRY_POTTER nearly fell out of a towering beech tree.
HARRY_POTTER steadied HARRY_POTTER in time to hear SNAPE say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
i'm waiting."
"b-but i d-d-DON't --"
    "very well," SNAPE cut in.
"we'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie."
SNAPE threw SNAPE clOAK over SNAPE head and strode out of the clearing.
it was almost dark now, but HARRY_POTTER could see QUIRTELL, standing quite still as though HARRY_POTTER was petrified.
"HARRY_POTTER, where have you been?"
HERMLONE squeaked.
"we won!
you won!
we won!"
shouTED "
    ron, thumping HARRY_POTTER on the back.
"and i gave "
    MALFOY a black eye, and MR._LONGBOTTOM tried to take on CRABBE and GOYLE single-handed!
he's still out cold but MADAM_POMFTEY says he'll be all right - talk about showing SLYTHERINS!
everyone's waiting for you in the common room, everyone's 're having a party, FRED_WEASLEY  and GEORGE_WEASLEY stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens."
"never mind that now," said HARRY_POTTER breathlessly.
"let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this...."
    he made sure peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then peeves told them what peeves'd seen and heard.
"so everyone's  were right, it is the sorcerer's stone, and SNAPE's trying to force QUIRTELL to help SNAPE get QUIRTELL.
peeves asked if peeves knew how to get past FLUFFY - and peeves said something about QUIRTELL's 'hocus pocuss-- i reckon there are other things guarding the sorcerer's stone apart from FLUFFY, loads of enchantments, probably, and QUIRTELL would have DONe some anti-dark arts spell that SNAPE needs to break through --"
    "so you mean the sorcerer's stone's only safe as long as QUIRTELL stands up to SNAPE?"
said HERMLONE in alarm.
"it'll be gone by next tuesday," said "
    ron.
chapter fourteen.
NORBERT the norwegian ridgeback.
QUIRTELL, however, must have been braver than QUIRTELL'd thought.
in the weeks that followed peeves did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though peeves'd cracked yet.
every time QUIRTELL passed the third-floor corridor, HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE would press QUIRTELL ears to the door  to check that FLUFFY was still growling inside.
SNAPE was sweeping about in SNAPE usual bad temper, which surely meant that the sorcerer's stone was still safe.
whenever HARRY_POTTER passed QUIRTELL these days HARRY_POTTER gave SNAPE an encouraging sort of smile, and "
    ron had starTED telling people off for laughing at QUIRTELL's stutter.
HERMLONE, however, had more on HERMLONE mind than the sorcerer's stone.
HERMLONE had starTED drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all HERMLONE notes.
HARRY_POTTER and "
    ron wouldn't have minded, but HERMLONE kept nagging HARRY_POTTER and ron to do the same.
"HERMLONE, the exams are ages away."
"ten weeks," HERMLONE snapped.
"that's not ages, that's like a second to MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel."
"but we're not six hundred years old," "
    ron reminded HERMLONE.
"anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it a."
"what am i studying for?
are you crazy?
you realize we need to pass the exams to get into the second year?
the exams're very important, i should have starTED studying a month ago, i DON't know what's gotten into me...."
    unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as HERMLONE.
the teachers piled so much homework on the teachers that the easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the christmas ones.
it was hard to relax with HERMLONE next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.
moaning and yawning, HARRY_POTTER and "
    ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
"i'll never remember this,"
    ron "
    ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down "
    ron quill and looking longingly out of the library window.
it was the first really fine day they'd had in months.
the sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
HARRY_POTTER, who was looking up "dittany" in one thousand magical herbs and fungi, didn't look up until "
    ron heard "
    ron say, "hagrid!
what are you doing in the library with her?"
hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind "
    hagrid back. "
hagrid looked very out of place in "
    hagrid moleskin overcoat.
"jus' lookin'," "
    hagrid said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.
"an' what're you lot up ter?"
"
    hagrid looked suddenly suspicious.
"yer not still lookin' for MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel, are YEH?"
"oh, we found out who "
    hagrid is ages ago," said "
    ron impressively.
"and we know what that dog's guarding, that dog's a sorcerer's st --"
    "shhhh!"
"
    hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
"DON' go shoutin' about shoutin, what's the matter with YEH?"
"there are a few things we wanTED to ask you, as a matter of fact," said HARRY_POTTER, "about what's guarding the sorcerer's stone apart from FLUFFY --"
    "shhhh!"
said "
    hagrid again.
"listen - come an' see me later, i'm not promisin' i'll tell YEH anythin', mind, but DON' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know.
students aren' s'pposed ter know'll think i've told YEH --"
    "see you later, then," said HARRY_POTTER.
    "
hagrid shuffled off.
"what was "
    hagrid hiding behind his back?"
said HERMLONE thoughtfully.
"do you think it had anything to do with the sorcerer's stone?"
"i'm going to see what section "
    hagrid was in," said ron, who'd had enough of working. "
hagrid came back a minute later with a pile of books in "
    hagrid arms and slammed them down on the table.
"dragons!"
"
    hagrid whispered.
". "
hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!
look at these: dragon species of great britain and ireland; from egg to inferno, a dragon keeper's guide."
". "
hagrid's always wanTED a dragon, "
    hagrid told me so the first time i ever met a dragon, " said HARRY_POTTER.
"but it's against our laws," said "
    ron.
"dragon breeding was outlawed by the WARLOCKs' convention of 1709, everyone knows that.
it's hard to stop muggles from noticing our if our're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous.
you should see the burns charlie's got off wild ones in romania."
"but there aren't wild dragons in great britain?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"of course there are," said "
    ron.
"common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks.
the ministry of magic has a job hushing common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks up, i can tell you.
our kind have to keep putting spells on muggleswho've spotTED common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks, to make common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks forget."
"so what on earths hagrid up to?"
said HERMLONE.
when common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. "
hagrid called "who is it?"
before "
    hagrid let common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks in, and then shut the door of the gamekeeper's hut quickly behind common welsh green and hebriDEAN_THOMAS blacks.
it was stifling hot inside.
even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. "
hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which them refused.
"so -- YEH wanTED to ask me somethin'?"
"yes," said HARRY_POTTER.
there was no point beating around the bush.
"we were wondering if you could tell we what's guarding the sorcerer's stone apart from FLUFFY."
hagrid frowned at the sorcerer's stone.
"0' course i cant, "
    hagrid said.
"number one, i DON' know meself.
number two, YEH know too much already, so i wouldn' tell YEH if i could.
that the sorcerer's stone's here for a good reason.
it was almost stolen outta GRINGOTTS - i s'ppose YEH've worked that out an' all?
beats me how YEH even know abou' FLUFFY."
"oh, come on, "
    hagrid, you might not want to tell we, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said HERMLONE in a warm, flattering voice.
hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell "
    hagrid was smiling.
"we only wondered who had DONe the guarding, really."
HERMLONE went on.
"we wondered who dumbledore had trusTED enough to help dumbledore, apart from dumbledore."
hagrid's chest swelled at these last words.
HARRY_POTTER and ron beamed at HERMLONE.
"well, i DON' s'pose it could hurt ter tell YEH that... letYEH see... YEH borrowed FLUFFY from YEH... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...
professor sprout -- professor FLITWICK -- professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL --" professor sprout -- professor FLITWICK -- professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL -- ticked the teachers  off on professor sprout -- professor FLITWICK -- professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL -- fingers, "professor QUIRTELL -- an' dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course.
hang on, i've forgotten someone.
oh yeah, SNAPE."
"SNAPE?"
"yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are YEH?
look, SNAPEhelped protect the sorcerer's stone, SNAPE's not about ter steal the sorcerer's stone."
HARRY_POTTER knew "
    ron and HERMLONE were thinking the same as SNAPE was.
if SNAPE had been in on protecting the sorcerer's stone, the sorcerer's stone must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded the sorcerer's stone.
SNAPE probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, QUIRTELL's spell and how to get past FLUFFY.
"you're the only one who knows how to get past FLUFFY.
aren't you, "
    hagrid?"
said HARRY_POTTER anxiously.
"and you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?
not even one of the other teachers?"
"not a soul knows except HARRY_POTTER an' dumbledore," said "
    hagrid proudly.
"well, that's something," HARRY_POTTER muttered to the others.
". "
hagrid, can we have a window open?
i'm boiling."
"can't, HARRY_POTTER, sorry," said "
    hagrid.
HARRY_POTTER noticed HARRY_POTTER glance at the fire.
HARRY_POTTER looked at him glance at the fire, too.
". "
hagrid -- what's that?"
but HARRY_POTTER already knew what it was.
in the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
"ah," said hagrid, fiddling nervously with HARRY_POTTER beard, "that's er..."
    "where did you get it, "
    hagrid?"
said "
    ron, crouching over the fireto get a closer look at a huge, black egg.
"it must've cost you a fortune."
"won it," said "
    hagrid.
"las' night.
i was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger.
think a game o' cards with a stranger was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
"but what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?"
said HERMLONE.
"well, i've bin doin' some readin' , said "
    hagrid, pulling a large book from under "
    hagrid pillow.
"got this outta the library -- dragon breeding for pleasure and profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here.
keep a huge, black egg in the fire, 'cause their MOTHERs breathe on i em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.
an' see here -- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs -- what i got there's a norwegian ridgeback.
they're rare, they."
he looked very pleased with he, but HERMLONE didn't.
". "
hagrid, you live in a WOODen house," "
    hagrid said.
but "
    hagrid wasn't listening. "
hagrid was humming merrily as "
    hagrid stoked the fire.
so now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to "
    hagrid if anyone found out "
    hagrid was hiding an illegal dragon in "
    hagrid hut.
"wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," "
    ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.
HERMLONE had now starTED making study schedules for HARRY_POTTER and ron, too.
it was driving HARRY_POTTER and ron nuts.
then, one breakfast time, HEDWIG brought HARRY_POTTER another note from "
    hagrid.
HARRY_POTTER had written only two words: it's hatching.
    "
ron wanTED to skip herbology and go straight down to his hut.
HERMLONE wouldn't hear of herbology.
"HERMLONE, how many times in our lives are our going to see a dragon hatching?"
"our've got lessons, our'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what "
    hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what someone's doing --"
    "shut up!"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
MALFOY was only a few feet away and MALFOY had stopped dead to listen.
how much had MALFOY heard?
HARRY_POTTER didn't like the look on MALFOY's face at all.
ron and HERMLONE argued all the way to herbology and in the end, HERMLONE agreed to run down to "
    hagrid's with the other two during morning break.
when the CHASER_KATIE_BELL sounded from the castle at the end of ron and HERMLONE lesson, the three of ron and HERMLONE dropped ron and HERMLONE trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. "
hagridgreeTED ron and HERMLONE, looking flushed and exciTED.
"it's nearly out."
"
    hagrid ushered ron and HERMLONE inside.
a huge, black egg was lying on the table.
there were deep cracks in a huge, black egg.
something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from a huge, black egg.
they all drew they all chairs up to the table and watched with baTED breath.
all at once there was a scraping noise and a huge, black egg split open.
the baby dragon flopped onto the table.
it wasn't exactly pretty; HARRY_POTTER thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.
the baby dragon spiny wings were huge compared to the baby dragon skinny jet body, the baby dragon had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.
the baby dragon sneezed.
a couple of sparks flew out of a couple of sparks snout.
"isn't he beautiful?"
"
    hagrid murmured.
he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head.
the baby dragon snapped at he fingers, showing poinTED FANGs.
"bless he, look, he knows he MOMmy!"
said "
    hagrid.
    "
hagrid," said HERMLONE, "how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow, exactly?"
hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from "
    hagrid face -- "
    hagrid leapt to "
    hagrid feet and ran to the window.
"what's the matter?"
"someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid -- "
    hagrid's runnin' back up ter the school."
HARRY_POTTER bolTED to the door and looked out.
even at a distance there was no mistaking "
    hagrid.
MALFOY had seen the dragon.
something about the smile lurking on MALFOY's face during the next week made HARRY_POTTER, "
    ron, and HERMLONE very nervous.
ron, and HERMLONE spent most of ron, and HERMLONE free time in "
    hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with "
    hagrid.
"just let "
    hagrid go,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER urged.
"set "
    hagrid free."
"i can't," said "
    hagrid.
". "
hagrid's too little. "
hagrid'd die."
ron, and HERMLONE looked at the dragon.
the dragon had grown three times in length in just a week.
smoke kept furling out of the dragon nostrils. "
hagrid hadn't been doing "
    hagrid gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping "
    hagrid so busy.
there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
"i've decided to call "
    hagrid NORBERT," said "
    hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes.
". "
hagrid really knows me now, watch.
NORBERT!
NORBERT!
where's MOMmy?"
". "
hagrid's lost "
    hagrid marbles,"
    ron "
    ron muttered in HARRY_POTTER's ear.
    "
hagrid," said HARRY_POTTER loudly, "give it two weeks and NORBERT's going to be as long as your house.
MALFOY could go to dumbledore at any MOMent."
hagrid bit dumbledore  lip.
"i -- i know i can't keep dumbledore  forever, but i can't jus' dump dumbledore , i can't."
HARRY_POTTER suddenly turned to "
    ron.
charlie, charlie said.
"you're losing it, too," said "
    ron.
"i'm "
    ron, remember?"
"no -- charlie -- your brother, charlie.
in romania.
studying dragons.
we could send NORBERT to NORBERT.
charlie can take care of charlie and then put charlie back in the wild!"
"brilliant!"
said "
    ron.
"how about it, "
    hagrid?"
and in the end, "
    hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to charlie to ask charlie.
the following week dragged by.
wednesday night found HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
the clock on the wall had just
    chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. "
ron appeared out of nowhere as "
    ron pulled off HARRY_POTTER's invisibility clOAK. "
ron had been down at "
    hagrid hut, helping "
    ron feed NORBERT, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
"it bit me!"
"
    ron said, showing them "
    ron hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief.
"i'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week.
i tell you, that the dragon's the most horrible animal i've ever met, but the way "
    hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a FLUFFY little bunny rabbit.
when it bit me "
    ron told me off for frightening it.
and when i left, "
    ron was singing it a lullaby."
there was a tap on the dark window.
"it's HEDWIG!"
said HARRY_POTTER, hurrying to let her in.
"her'll have charlie's answer!"
the three of them put them heads together to read the note.
    "
ron,
    how are you?
thanks for the letter -- i'd be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting the norwegian ridgeback here.
i think the best thing will be to send the norwegian ridgeback over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.
trouble is, trouble mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.
could you get the norwegian ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday?
trouble can meet you there and take the norwegian ridgeback away while it's still dark.
send me an answer as soon as possible.
love,
    charlie
    they looked at one another.
"we've got the invisibility clOAK," said HARRY_POTTER.
"it shouldn't be too difficult -- i think the clOAKs big enough to cover two of us and NORBERT."
it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with the norwegian ridgeback.
anything to get rid of NORBERT -- and MALFOY.
there was a hitch.
by the next morning, "
    ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice ron's bitten hand usual size. "
ron didn't know whether it was safe to go to MADAM_POMFTEY -- would MADAM_POMFTEY recognize a dragon bite?
by the afternoon, though, "
    ron had no choice.
the cut had turned a nasty shade of green.
the cut looked as if NORBERT's FANGs were poisonous.
HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find "
    ron in a terrible state in bed.
"it's not just ron's bitten hand," "
    ron whispered, "although that feels like it's about to fall off.
MALFOY told MADAM_POMFTEY MALFOY wanTED to borrow one of my books so MALFOY could come and have a good laugh at me.
MALFOY kept threatening to tell MADAM_POMFTEY what really bit me -- i've told MADAM_POMFTEY it was a dog, but i DON't think MADAM_POMFTEY believes me -i shouldn't have hit MALFOY at the quidditch match, that's why MALFOY's doing this."
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE tried to calm "
    ron down.
"it'll all be over at midnight on saturday," said "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONEbut this didn't soothe "
    ron at all.
on the contrary, "
    ron sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.
"midnight on saturday!"
"
    ron said in a hoarse voice.
"oh no oh no -- i've just remembered -- charlie's letter was in that book MALFOY took, "
    ron's going to know we're getting rid of NORBERT."
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE didn't get a chance to answer.
MADAM_POMFTEYcame over at that MOMent and made "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE leave, saying "
    ron needed sLEE_JORDANp.
"it's too late to change the plan now,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER told HERMLONE.
"we haven't got time to send charlie another owl, and this could be we only chance to get rid of NORBERT.
we'll have to risk it.
and we have got the invisibility clOAK, MALFOY doesn't know about that."
they found FANG, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid, who opened a window to talk to they.
"i won't let you in," he puffed.
"NORBERT's at a tricky stage -- nothin' i can't handle."
when they told NORBERT about charlie's letter, NORBERT eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because NORBERT had just bitten NORBERT on the leg.
"aargh!
it's all right, NORBERT only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- NORBERT's only a baby, after all."
only a baby banged only a baby tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.
HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn't come quickly enough.
HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER would have felt sorry for "
    hagrid when the time came for "
    hagrid to say good-bye to NORBERT if HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER hadn't been so worried about what HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER had to do.
it was a very dark, cloudy night, and HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER were a bit late arriving at hagrid's hut because HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER'd had to wait for peeves to get out of HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. "
hagrid had NORBERTpacked and ready in a large crate.
"he's got lots o' rats an' some brandy for the journey," said hagrid in a muffled voice.
"an' i've packed he TEDdy bear in case he gets lonely."
from inside a large crate came ripping noises that sounded to HARRY_POTTERas though his TEDdy was having his TEDdy head torn off.
"bye-bye, NORBERT!"
"
    hagrid sobbed, as HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER covered the crate with the invisibility clOAK and stepped underneath the invisibility clOAK themselves.
"MOMmy will never forget you!"
how themselves managed to get a large crate back up to the castle, themselves never knew.
midnight ticked nearer as themselves heaved NORBERTup the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
up another staircase, then another -- even one of HARRY_POTTER's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.
"nearly there!"
HARRY_POTTER panTED as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
then a sudden movement ahead of they made they almost drop a large crate.
forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
a lamp flared.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had MALFOY by the ear.
"detention!"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL shouTED.
"and twenty points from SLYTHERINS!
wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --"
    "you DON't understand, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
HARRY_POTTER's coming -- professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's got a dragon!"
"what utter rubbish!
how dare you tell such lies!
come on -- i shall see professor SNAPE about you, MALFOY!"
the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the invisibility clOAK, glad to be able to breathe properly again.
HERMLONE did a sort of jig.
"MALFOY's got detention!
i could sing!"
"DON't," HARRY_POTTER advised HARRY_POTTER.
chuckling about MALFOY, they waiTED, NORBERT thrashing about in a large crate.
about ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.
charlie's friends were a cheery lot.
charlie's friends showed HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE the harness charlie's friends'd rigged up, so charlie's friends could suspend NORBERTbetween charlie's friends.
charlie's friends helped buckle NORBERT safely into it and then HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER shook hands with the others and thanked HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER very much.
at last, NORBERT was going... going... gone.
HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER slipped back down the spiral staircase, HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER hearts as light as HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER hands, now that NORBERT was off HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER.
no more dragon -- MALFOY in detention -- what could spoil no more dragon -- MALFOY in detention -- happiness?
the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs.
as HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER stepped into the corridor, FILCH's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
"well, well, well," NORBERT whispered, "we are in trouble."
HERMLONE and HARRY_POTTER'd left the invisibility clOAK on top of the tower.
chapter fifteen.
the foribidden forest.
things couldn't have been worse.
FILCH took things down to professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's study on the first floor, where things sat and waiTED without saying a word to each other.
HERMLONE was trembling.
excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around HARRY_POTTER's brain, each more feeble than the last.
NORBERT couldn't see how excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories were going to get out of trouble this time.
excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories were cornered.
how could excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories have been so stupid as to forget the invisibility clOAK?
there was no reason on earth that professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
NORBERT and the invisibility clOAK, and add NORBERT and the invisibility clOAK might as well be packing add NORBERT and the invisibility clOAK bags already.
had HARRY_POTTER thought that things couldn't have been worse?
had HARRY_POTTER was wrong.
when professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL appeared, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was leading MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"HARRY_POTTER!"
MR._LONGBOTTOM burst out, the MOMent MR._LONGBOTTOM saw the other two.
"i was trying to find you to warn you, i heard MALFOY saying MALFOY was going to catch you, MALFOY said you had a drag --"
    HARRY_POTTER shook MALFOY head violently to shut MR._LONGBOTTOM up, but professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had seen.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL looked more likely to breathe fire than NORBERT as professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL towered over the three of them.
"i would never have believed it of any of you.
FILCHsays you were up in the tower.
it's one o'clock in the morning.
explain yourselves."
it was the first time HERMLONE had ever failed to answer a teacher's question.
HERMLONE was staring at HERMLONE slippers, as still as a statue.
"i think i've got a good idea of what's been going on," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"it doesn't take a genius to work it out.
you fed MALFOY some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get MALFOY out of bed and into trouble.
i've already caught MALFOY.
i suppose you think it's funny that longbotTOM here heard the story and believed the story , too?"
HARRY_POTTER caught MR._LONGBOTTOM's eye and tried to tell HARRY_POTTER without words that this wasn't true, because MR._LONGBOTTOM was looking stunned and hurt.
poor, blundering MR._LONGBOTTOM -- HARRY_POTTER knew what it must have cost HARRY_POTTER to try and find MR._LONGBOTTOM was looking stunned and hurt in the dark, to warn MR._LONGBOTTOM was looking stunned and hurt.
"i'm disgusTED," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"four students out of bed in one night!
i've never heard of such a thing before!
you, MR._GRANGER, i thought you had more sense.
as for you, mr. POTTER, i thought GRYFFINDOR meant more to you than this.
all three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, longbotTOM here, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from GRYFFINDOR."
"fifty?"
HARRY_POTTER gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead HARRY_POTTER'd won in the last quidditch match.
"fifty points each," said professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, breathing heavily through professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL long, poinTED nose.
"professor -- please
    "you can't --"
    "DON't tell me what i can and can't do, HARRY_POTTER's.
now get back to bed, all of HARRY_POTTER's.
i've never been more ashamed of GRYFFINDOR students."
a hundred and fifty points lost.
that put GRYFFINDOR in last place.
in one night, they'd ruined any chance GRYFFINDOR had had for the house cup.
HARRY_POTTER felt as though the botTOM had dropped out of HARRY_POTTER sTOMach.
how could they ever make up for this?
HARRY_POTTER didn't sLEE_JORDANp all night.
HARRY_POTTER could hear MR._LONGBOTTOM sobbing into HARRY_POTTER pillow for what seemed like hours.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't think of anything to say to comfort HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER knew MR._LONGBOTTOM, like HARRY_POTTER, was dreading the dawn.
what would happen when the rest of GRYFFINDOR found out what the rest of GRYFFINDOR 'd DONe?
at first, GRYFFINDORs passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake.
how could the rest of GRYFFINDOR  suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?
and then the story  starTED to spread: HARRY_POTTER's, the famous HARRY_POTTER, the rest of GRYFFINDOR  hero of two quidditch matches, had lo st the rest of GRYFFINDOR  all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, HARRY_POTTER was suddenly the most haTED.
even RAVENCLAWs and HUFFLEPUFFS turned on HARRY_POTTER, because everyone had been longing to see SLYTHERINS lose the house cup.
everywhere HARRY_POTTER went, people poinTED and didn't trouble to lower people  voices as people  insulTED HARRY_POTTER.
SLYTHERINS, on the other hand, clapped as HARRY_POTTER walked past them, whistling and cheering, "thanks POTTER, them owe you one!"
only ron stood by only ron.
"them'll all forget this in a few weeks.
FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY have lost loads of points in all the time FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY've been here, and people still like FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY."
"FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY?"
said HARRY_POTTER miserably.
"well -- no," only ron admitTED.
it was a bit late to repair the damage, but HARRY_POTTER swore to HARRY_POTTER not to meddle in things that weren't HARRY_POTTER business from now on.
HARRY_POTTER'd had it with sneaking around and spying.
HARRY_POTTER felt so ashamed of HARRY_POTTER that HARRY_POTTER went to WOOD and offered to resign from the quidditch team.
"resign?"
WOOD thundered.
"what good'll that do?
how are we going to get any points back if we can't win at quidditch?"
but quidditch quidditch had lost quidditch fun.
the rest of the team wouldn't speak to HARRY_POTTER during practice, and if they had to speak about HARRY_POTTER, they called HARRY_POTTER "the seeker."
HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM were suffering, too. "
HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM didn't have as bad a time as HARRY_POTTER, because "
    HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to "
    HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM, either.
HERMLONE had stopped drawing attention to HERMLONE in class, keeping HERMLONE head down and working in silence.
HARRY_POTTER was almost glad that the exams weren't far away.
all the studying HARRY_POTTER had to do kept HARRY_POTTER mind off HARRY_POTTER misery.
HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE kept to he, ron, and HERMLONE, working late into the night, trying to remember the inGREDients in complicaTED potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin reCHASER_KATIE_BELLions....
    then, about a week before the exams were due to start, HARRY_POTTER's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern HARRY_POTTER's
was put to an unexpecTED test.
walking back from the library on HARRY_POTTER's
own one afternoon, HARRY_POTTER's  heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
as HARRY_POTTER's  drew closer, HARRY_POTTER's  heard QUIRTELL's voice.
"no -- no -- not again, please --"
    it sounded as though someone was threatening someone.
HARRY_POTTER moved closer.
"all right -- all right --" HARRY_POTTER's  heard QUIRTELL sob.
next second, QUIRTELL came hurrying out of the classroom straightening QUIRTELL turban.
QUIRTELL was pale and looked as though QUIRTELL was about to cry.
QUIRTELL strode out of sight; HARRY_POTTER didn't think QUIRTELLhad even noticed QUIRTELL.
QUIRTELL waiTED until QUIRTELL's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom straightening his turban.
it was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.
HARRY_POTTER was halfway toward it before HARRY_POTTER remembered what HARRY_POTTER'd promised HARRY_POTTER about not meddling.
all the same, HARRY_POTTER'd have gambled twelve sorcerer's stones that SNAPE had just left the room, and from what HARRY_POTTER had just heard, SNAPE would be walking with a new spring in HARRY_POTTER step -- QUIRTELLseemed to have given in at last.
HARRY_POTTER went back to the library, where HERMLONE was testing only ron on astronomy.
HARRY_POTTER told the library, where HERMLONE was testing ron on astronomy what HARRY_POTTER'd heard.
"SNAPE's DONe it, then!"
said only ron.
"if QUIRTELL's told SNAPE how to break SNAPE anti-dark force spell --"
    "there's still FLUFFY, though," said HERMLONE.
"maybe SNAPE's found out how to get past SNAPE without asking hagrid," said only ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.
"i bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog.
so what do we do, HARRY_POTTER?"
the light of adventure was kindling again in only ron's eyes, but HERMLONE answered before HARRY_POTTER could.
"go to dumbledore.
that's what we should have DONe ages ago.
if we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
"but we've got no proof!"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"QUIRTELL's too scared to back we up.
SNAPE's only got to say SNAPE doesn't know how the troll got in at halloween and that SNAPE was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think the troll 'll believe, him or we?
it's not exactly a secret we hate SNAPE, dumbledore'll think we made it up to get dumbledore'llsacked.
FILCH wouldn't help we if FILCH life depended on his life, FILCH's too friendly with SNAPE, and the more students get thrown out, the better, FILCH'll think.
and DON't forget, we're not supposed to know about the stone or FLUFFY.
that'll take a lot of explaining."
HERMLONE looked convinced, but only ron didn't.
"if we just do a bit of poking around --"
    "no," said HARRY_POTTER flatly, "we've DONe enough poking around."
only ron pulled a map of jupiter toward only ron and starTED to learn the names of its moons.
the following morning, notes were delivered to HARRY_POTTER, HERMLONE, and MR._LONGBOTTOM at the breakfast table.
HARRY_POTTER, HERMLONE, and MR._LONGBOTTOM were all the same:
    your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight.
meet mr. FILCH in the entrance hall.
HARRY_POTTER had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost.
HARRY_POTTER half expecTED HERMLONE to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but HERMLONE didn't say a word.
like HARRY_POTTER, HERMLONE felt they deserved what they'd got.
at eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to only ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with MR._LONGBOTTOM.
FILCH was already there -- and so was MALFOY.
HARRY_POTTER had also forgotten that MALFOY had gotten a detention, too.
"follow me," said FILCH , lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
i bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?"
he said, LEE_JORDANring at them.
"oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me....
it's just a pity the best teachers let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, i've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case the chains're ever needed....
right, off we go, and DON't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do."
the chains marched off across the dark grounds.
MR._LONGBOTTOM kept sniffing.
HARRY_POTTER wondered what the chains punishment was going to be.
it must be something really horrible, or FILCH  wouldn't be sounding so delighTED.
the moon was bright, but clouds scudding across the moon kept throwing them into darkness.
ahead, HARRY_POTTER could see the lighTED windows of hagrid's hut.
then them heard a distant shout.
"is that you, FILCH ?
hurry up, i want ter get starTED."
HARRY_POTTER's heart rose; if them were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn't be so bad.
hagrid  relief must have showed in hagrid  -face, because FILCH  said, "i suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and i'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
at this, MR._LONGBOTTOM let out a little moan, and MALFOY stopped dead in MR._LONGBOTTOM tracks.
"the forest?"
MR._LONGBOTTOM repeaTED, and MR._LONGBOTTOM didn't sound quite as cool as usual.
"we can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, i heard."
MR._LONGBOTTOM clutched the sLEE_JORDANve of HARRY_POTTER's robe and made a choking noise.
"that's your problem, isn't it?"
said FILCH, FILCH voice cracking with gLEE_JORDAN.
"should've thought of FILCH, his voice cracking with gLEE_JORDAN werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?"
hagrid came striding toward FILCH, his voice cracking with gLEE_JORDAN out of the dark, FANG at FANG heel.
FANG was carrying FANG large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over FANG shoulder.
"abou' time," abou' said.
"i bin waitin' for half an hour already.
all right, "
    HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM?"
"i shouldn't be too friendly to "
    HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM, hagrid," said FILCH coldly, "
    HERMLONE and MR._LONGBOTTOM're here to be punished, after all."
"that's why yer late, is it?"
said "
    hagrid, frowning atFILCH.
"bin lecturin' them, eh?
'snot your place ter do that.
YEH've DONe yer bit, i'll take over from here."
"i'll be back at dawn," said FILCH, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and starTED back toward the castle, he lamp bobbing away in darkness.
MALFOY now turned to "
    hagrid.
"i'm not going in that forest, he said, and HARRY_POTTER was pleased to hear the note of panic in HARRY_POTTER voice.
"he are if he want ter stay at hogwarts," said "
    hagridfiercely.
"YEH've DONe wrong an' now YEHve got ter pay for it."
"but this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do.
i thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew i was doing this, my father'd
    tell yer that's how it is at hogwarts," hagrid growled.
"copyin' lines!
what good's that ter anyone?
YEH'll do summat useful or YEH'll get out.
if he think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack.
go on"'
    MALFOY didn't move. "'
MALFOY looked at "
    hagrid furiously, but then dropped "'
    MALFOY gaze.
"right then," said "
    hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' i DON' want no one takin' risks.
follow me over here a MOMent."
"'
    MALFOY led no one takin' risks to the very edge of the forest.
holding "'
    MALFOY up high, "'
    MALFOY poinTED down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.
a light breeze lifTED no one takin' risks hair as no one takin' risks looked into the forest.
"look there," said "
    hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
silvery stuff?
that's unicorn blood.
there's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.
this is the second time in a week.
i found one dead last wednesday.
we're gonna try an' find the poor thing.
we might have ter put ter out of ter misery."
"and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds we first?"
said MALFOY, unable to keep the fear out of MALFOY voice.
"there's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt he if yer with me or FANG," said "
    hagrid.
"an' keep ter the path.
right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions.
there's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least."
"i want FANG," said MALFOY quickly, looking at FANG's long teeth.
"all right, but i warn YEH, he's a coward," said "
    hagrid. "
so me, HARRY_POTTER, an' HERMLONE'll go one way an' draco, MR._LONGBOTTOM, an' FANG'll go the other.
now, if any of us finds the unicorn, us'll send up green sparks, right?
get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find YEH -- so, be careful -- letwe go."
the forest was black and silent.
a little way into the forest they reached a fork in the earth path, and HARRY_POTTER, HERMLONE, and hagrid took the left path while MALFOY, MR._LONGBOTTOM, and FANG took the right.
MALFOY, MR._LONGBOTTOM, and FANG walked in silence, MALFOY, MR._LONGBOTTOM, and FANG eyes on the ground.
every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.
HARRY_POTTER saw that "
    hagrid looked very worried.
"could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?"
HARRY_POTTER asked.
"not fast enough," said "
    hagrid.
"it's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures.
i never knew one ter be hurt before."
they walked past a mossy tree stump.
HARRY_POTTER could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.
there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
"you all right, HERMLONE?"
"
    hagrid whispered.
"DON' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- get behind that tree!"
hagrid seized HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE and hoisTED HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE off the path behind a towering OAK. "
hagrid pulled out an arrow and fitTED an arrowinto "
    hagrid crossbow, raising an arrow, ready to fire.
the three of HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE listened.
something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a clOAK trailing along the ground. "
hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.
"i knew it, " "
    hagrid murmured.
"there's summat in here that shouldn' be."
"a werewolf?"
HARRY_POTTER suggesTED.
"that wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said "
    hagrid grimly.
"right, follow me, but careful, now."
they walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
"who's there?"
"
    hagrid called.
"show yerself -- i'm armed!"
and into a clearing ahead came -- was it a man, or a horse?
to the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail.
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE's jaws dropped.
"oh, it's you, RONAN," said "
    hagrid.
"how are YEH?"
he walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.
"good evening to you, hagrid," said RONAN.
RONAN had a deep, sorrowful voice.
"were you going to shoot me?"
"can't be too careful, RONAN," said "
    hagrid, patting RONAN crossbow.
"there's summat bad loose in the forest.
this is HARRY_POTTER an' HERMIONE_GRANGER, by the way.
students up at the school.
an' this is RONAN, you two.
he's a centaur.))
"we'd noticed," said HERMLONE faintly.
"good evening," said RONAN.
"students, are you?
and do you learn much, up at the school?"
"erm --"
    "a bit," said HERMLONE timidly.
"a bit.
well, that's something."
RONAN sighed.
RONAN flung back RONAN head and stared at the sky.
"mars is bright tonight."
"yeah," said "
    hagrid, glancing up, too.
"listen, i'm glad we've run inter YEH, RONAN, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
RONAN didn't answer immediately. "
RONAN stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.
"always the innocent are the first victims," "
    RONAN said.
"so it has been for ages past, so it is now."
"yeah," said "
    hagrid, "but have YEH seen anythin', RONAN?
anythin' unusual?"
"mars is bright tonight," RONAN repeaTED, while "
    hagrid watched RONAN impatiently.
"unusually bright."
"yeah, but i was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said "
    hagrid.
"so YEH haven't noticed anythin' strange?"
yet again, RONAN took a while to answer.
at last, RONAN said, "the forest hides many secrets."
a movement in the trees behind RONAN made "
    hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than RONAN.
"hullo, BANE," said "
    hagrid.
"all right?"
"good evening, "
    hagrid, i hope you are well?"
"well enough.
look, i've jus' bin askin' RONAN, you seen anythin' odd in here lately?
there's a unicorn bin injured -- would YEH know anythin' about it?"
hullo, BANE walked over to stand next to RONAN. "
BANE looked skyward.
"marsis bright tonight," "
    BANE said simply.
"we've heard," said "
    hagrid grumpily.
"well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't YEH?
we'll be off, then."
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE followed "
    BANE out of a clearing ahead, staring over "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE shoulders at RONAN and BANE until the trees blocked "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE view.
"never," said "
    hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur.
ruddy stargazers.
not interesTED in anythin' closer'n the moon."
"are there many of "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE in here?"
asked HERMLONE.
"oh, a fair few... keep "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE to "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE mostly, but "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE're good enough about turnin' up if ever i want a word. "
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE're deep, mind, centaurs... "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE know things... jus' DON' let on much."
"d'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"did that sound like hooves to you?
nah, if he ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before."
"
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE walked on through the dense, dark trees.
HARRY_POTTER kept looking nervously over HARRY_POTTER shoulder.
HARRY_POTTER had the nasty feeling "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE were being watched.
HARRY_POTTER was very glad "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE had "
    hagrid and HARRY_POTTER crossbow with "
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE. "
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE had just passed a bend in the path when HERMLONE grabbed hagrid's arm.
"hagrid!
look!
red sparks, the others are in trouble!"
"you two wait here!"
"
    hagrid shouTED.
"stay on the path, i'll come back for he!"
they heard he crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around they.
"you DON't think they've been hurt, do you?"
whispered HERMLONE.
"i DON't care if MALFOY has, but if something's got MR._LONGBOTTOM... it's our fault he's here in the first place."
the minutes dragged by.
their ears seemed sharper than usual.
HARRY_POTTER's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.
what was going on?
where were the others?
at last, a great crunching noise announced "
    hagrid return.
MALFOY, MR._LONGBOTTOM, and FANG were with FANG.
hagrid's  was fuming.
MALFOY, it seemed, had sneaked up behind MR._LONGBOTTOM and grabbed MR._LONGBOTTOM as a joke.
MR._LONGBOTTOM had paNICKed and sent up red sparks.
"we'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'.
right, we're changin' groups -- MR._LONGBOTTOM, you stay with me an' HERMLONE, HARRY_POTTER, you go with FANG an' this idiot.
i'm sorry,hagrid's  added in a whisper to HARRY_POTTER, "but hagrid's 'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this DONe."
so HARRY_POTTER set off into the heart of the forest with MALFOY and FANG.
they walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.
HARRY_POTTER thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.
there were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.
HARRY_POTTER could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient OAK.
"look --" HARRY_POTTER murmured, holding out HARRY_POTTER arm to stop MALFOY.
something bright white was gleaming on the ground.
something bright white inched closer.
it was the unicorn all right, and it was dead.
HARRY_POTTER had never seen anything so beautiful and sad.
it long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and it mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
HARRY_POTTER had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made HARRY_POTTER freeze where HARRY_POTTER stood.
a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.
HARRY_POTTER, MALFOY, and FANG stood transfixed.
a hooded figure reached the unicorn, lowered a hooded figure head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink a hooded figure blood.
"aaaaaaaaaargh!"
MALFOY let out a terrible scream and bolTED -- so did FANG.
a hooded figure raised its head and looked right at HARRY_POTTER -- unicorn blood was dribbling down a hooded figure front.
a hooded figure got to a hooded figure feet and came swiftly toward HARRY_POTTER -- HARRY_POTTER couldn't move for fear.
then a pain like HARRY_POTTER'd never felt before pierced its head; it was as though HARRY_POTTER scar were on fire.
half blinded, HARRY_POTTER staggered backward.
HARRY_POTTER heard hooves behind HARRY_POTTER, galloping, and something jumped clean over HARRY_POTTER, charging at a hooded figure.
the pain in HARRY_POTTER's head was so bad HARRY_POTTER fell to HARRY_POTTER knees.
it took a minute or two to pass.
when HARRY_POTTER looked up, a hooded figure had gone.
a centaur was standing over HARRY_POTTER, not RONAN or BANE; this one looked younger; HARRY_POTTER had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
"are you all right?"
said the centaur, pulling HARRY_POTTER to its feet.
"yes -- thank you -- what was that?"
the centaur didn't answer.
HARRY_POTTER had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires.
HARRY_POTTER looked carefully at HARRY_POTTER, astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on HARRY_POTTER's forehead.
"you are the POTTER boy," the POTTER boy said.
"you had better get back to "
    hagrid.
the forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you.
can you ride?
it will be quicker this way.
"my name is FIRENZE," my name added, as my name lowered my name on to my name front legs so that HARRY_POTTER could clamber onto HARRY_POTTER back.
there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing.
RONAN or BANE came bursting through the trees, RONAN or BANE flanks heaving and sweaty.
"FIRENZE!"
BANE thundered.
"what are you doing?
you have a human on your back!
have you no shame?
are you a common mule?"
"do you realize who this is?"
said FIRENZE.
"this is the POTTER boy.
the quicker the POTTER boy leaves the forest, the better."
"what have you been telling the POTTER boy?"
growled BANE.
"remember, FIRENZE, we are sworn not to set we against the heavens.
have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
RONAN pawed the ground nervously.
"i'm sure FIRENZE thought FIRENZE was acting for the best, " FIRENZE said in FIRENZE gloomy voice.
BANE kicked BANE back legs in anger.
"for the best!
what is that to do with we?
centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold!
it is not we business to run around like DONkeys after stray humans in we !"
FIRENZE suddenly reared on to "
    FIRENZE hind legs in anger, so that HARRY_POTTER had to grab HARRY_POTTER shoulders to stay on.
"do you not see that unicorn?"
FIRENZE CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed at BANE.
"do you not understand why it was killed?
or have the planets not let you in on that secret?
i set myself against what is lurking in this forest, BANE, yes, with humans alongside myself if i must."
and "
    FIRENZE whisked around; with HARRY_POTTER clutching on as best HARRY_POTTER could, HARRY_POTTER clutching on as best  plunged off into the trees, leaving RONAN and BANEBANEbehind HARRY_POTTER clutching on as best .
HARRY_POTTER didn't have a clue what was going on.
"why's BANE so angry?"
HARRY_POTTER asked.
"what was that thing you saved me from, anyway?"
FIRENZE slowed to a walk, warned HARRY_POTTER to keep HARRY_POTTER head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer HARRY_POTTERquestion.
they made they way through the trees in silence for so long that HARRY_POTTER thought "
    FIRENZE didn't want to talk to "
    FIRENZEanymore.
they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when "
    FIRENZE suddenly stopped.
"HARRY_POTTER, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?"
"no," said HARRY_POTTER, startled by the odd question.
"we've only used the horn and tail hair in potions."
"that is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said "
    FIRENZE.
"only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.
what unicorn blood will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.
you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the MOMent what unicorn blood touches your lips.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER stared at the back of "
    FIRENZE's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
"but who'd be that desperate?"
HARRY_POTTER wondered aloud.
"if you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"
"it is," "
    FIRENZE agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.
HARRY_POTTER, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very MOMent?"
"the sorcerer's stone!
of course -- the elixir of life!
but i DON't understand who --"
    "can you think of nobody who has waiTED many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around HARRY_POTTER's heart.
over the rustling of the trees, HARRY_POTTER seemed to hear once more what hagrid's  had told HARRY_POTTER on the night they had met: "some say HARRY_POTTER died.
codswallop, in my opinion.
dunno if HARRY_POTTER had enough human left in HARRY_POTTER to die."
"do you mean," HARRY_POTTER crOAKed, "that was vol-"
    "HARRY_POTTER!
HARRY_POTTER, are you all right?"
HERMLONE  was running toward them down the path, hagrid's  puffing along behind HERMLONE .
"i'm fine," said HARRY_POTTER, hardly knowing what HARRY_POTTER was saying.
"the unicorn's dead, hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
"this is where i leave you,"
    FIRENZE murmured as hagrid's  hurried off to examine the unicorn.
"you are safe now.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER slid off HARRY_POTTER back.
"good luck, HARRY_POTTER," said "
    FIRENZE.
"the planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.
i hope this is one of those times."
HARRY_POTTER turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving HARRY_POTTER shivering behind HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER had fallen asLEE_JORDANp in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.
HARRY_POTTER shouTED something about quidditch fouls when HARRY_POTTER roughly shook HARRY_POTTER awake.
in a matter of seconds, though, HARRY_POTTER was wide-eyed as HARRY_POTTER began to tell HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE  what had happened in the forest.
HARRY_POTTER couldn't sit down.
HARRY_POTTER paced up and down in front of the fire.
HARRY_POTTER was still shaking.
"SNAPE wants the stone for VOLDEMORT... and VOLDEMORT's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought SNAPE just wanTED to get rich...."
    "stop saying the name!"
said HARRY_POTTER in a terrified whisper, as if HARRY_POTTER thought VOLDEMORT could hear them.
HARRY_POTTER wasn't listening.
". "
FIRENZE saved me, but "
    FIRENZE shouldn't have DONe so.... BANE was furious... BANE was talking about interfering with what the planetssay is going to happen.... the planets must show that VOLDEMORT's coming back.... BANE thinks "
    FIRENZE should have let VOLDEMORT kill me....
i suppose that's written in the stars as well."
"will you stop saying the name!"
HARRY_POTTER hissed.
"so all i've got to wait for now is SNAPE to steal the sorcerer's stone," HARRY_POTTER went on feverishly, "then VOLDEMORT will be able to come and finish me off... well, i suppose BANE'll be happy.HERMLONE  looked very frightened, but HERMLONE  had a word of comfort.
"HARRY_POTTER, everyone says dumbledore's the only one YOU-KNOW-who was ever afraid of with dumbledore around, YOU-KNOW-who won't touch you.
anyway, who says the centaurs are right?
it sounds like fortune-telling to YOU-KNOW-who, and professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."
the sky had turned light before they stopped talking.
they went to bed exhausTED, they throats sore.
but the night's surprises weren't over.
when HARRY_POTTER pulled back HARRY_POTTER sheets, HARRY_POTTER found HARRY_POTTER invisibility clOAK folded neatly underneath his sheets.
there was a note pinned to it:
    just in case.
chapter sixteen.
through the trapdoor.
in years to come, HARRY_POTTER would never quite remember how HARRY_POTTER had managed to get through HARRY_POTTER exams when HARRY_POTTER half expecTED VOLDEMORT to come bursting through the door at any MOMent.
yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that FLUFFY was still alive and well behind the locked door.
it was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did they written papers.
they had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell.
they had practical exams as well.
professor FLITWICK called they one by one into professor FLITWICK class to see if them  could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL watched them  turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if the snuffbox had whiskers.
SNAPE made whiskers all nervous, breathing down whiskers necks while whiskers tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion.
HARRY_POTTER did the best HARRY_POTTER could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in HARRY_POTTER forehead, which had been bothering HARRY_POTTER ever since HARRY_POTTER trip into the forest.
MR._LONGBOTTOM thought HARRY_POTTER had a bad case of exam nerves because HARRY_POTTER couldn't sLEE_JORDANp, but the truth was that HARRY_POTTERkept being woken by HARRY_POTTER old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it was now worse .
maybe it was because they hadn't seen what HARRY_POTTER had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on they foreheads, but HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE  didn't seem as worried about the sorcerer's stone.
the idea of VOLDEMORT certainly scared ron and HERMLONE, but VOLDEMORT didn't keep visiting ron and HERMLONE in dreams, and ron and HERMLONE were so busy with ron and HERMLONE studying ron and HERMLONE didn't have much time to fret about what SNAPE or anyone else might be up to.
ron and HERMLONE very last exam was history of magic.
one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invenTED selfstirring cauldrons and ron and HERMLONE'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until ron and HERMLONE exam results came out.
when the ghost of professor BINNS told ron and HERMLONE to put down ron and HERMLONE quills and roll up ron and HERMLONE parchment, HARRY_POTTER couldn't help cheering with the rest.
"that was far easier than i thought it would be," said HERMLONE as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.
"i needn't have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager."
HERMLONE  always liked to go through ron and HERMLONE exam papers afterward, but HARRY_POTTER said this made HARRY_POTTER feel ill, so ron and HERMLONE wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
the weasley twins and LEE_JORDAN were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.
"no more studying," HARRY_POTTER sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.
"you could look more cheerful, HARRY_POTTER, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've DONe, there's no need to worry yet."
HARRY_POTTER was rubbing HARRY_POTTER forehead.
"i wish i knew what this means!"
HARRY_POTTER burst out angrily.
"my scar keeps hurting -- my scar 's happened before, but never as often as this."
"go to MADAM_POMFTEY," HERMLONE  suggesTED.
"i'm not ill," said HARRY_POTTER.
"i think it's a warning... it means danger's coming...."
    HARRY_POTTER couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
"HARRY_POTTER, relax, HERMLONE 's right, the stone's safe as long as dumbledore's around.
anyway, we've never had any proof SNAPE found out how to get past FLUFFY.
SNAPE nearly had SNAPE leg ripped off once, SNAPE's not going to try his leg again in a hurry.
and MR._LONGBOTTOM will play quidditch for england before hagrid's  lets dumbledore down."
HARRY_POTTER nodded, but HARRY_POTTER couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something HARRY_POTTER'd forgotten to do, something important.
when HARRY_POTTER tried to explain this, HERMLONE  said, "that's just the exams.
i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we'd DONe that one."
HARRY_POTTER was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though.
HARRY_POTTER watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in a note mouth.
hagrid was the only one who ever sent HARRY_POTTER letters.
hagrid  would never betray dumbledore.
hagrid  would never tell anyone how to get past FLUFFY... never... but --
    HARRY_POTTER suddenly jumped to HARRY_POTTER feet.
"where're you going?"
said HARRY_POTTER sLEE_JORDANpily.
"i've just thought of something," said HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER had turned white.
"we've got to go and see hagrid , now."
"why?"
panTED HERMLONE, hurrying to keep up.
"DON't you think it's a bit odd," said HARRY_POTTER, scrambling up the grassy slope, "that what hagrid  wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in HARRY_POTTER pocket?
how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?
lucky how many people found hagrid , DON't you think?
why didn't i see hagrid  before?"
"what are you talking about?"
said HARRY_POTTER, but HARRY_POTTER, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.
hagrid's  was sitting in an armchair outside hagrid's  house; hagrid's trousers and sLEE_JORDANves were rolled up, and hagrid's  was shelling peas into a large bowl.
"hullo," hagrid's  said, smiling.
"finished yer exams?
got time fer a drink?"
"yes, please," said HARRY_POTTER, but HARRY_POTTER cut HARRY_POTTER off.
"no, we're in a hurry.
hagrid's , i've got to ask you something.
you know that night you won NORBERT?
what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?"
"dunno," said hagrid's  casually, "hagrid's  wouldn' take hagrid's  clOAK off."
hagrid's  saw the three of them look stunned and raised hagrid's  eyebrows.
"it's not that unusual, YEH get a lot o' funny folk in the hog's head -- that's the pub down in the village.
mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' mighta bin?
i never saw mighta bin face, mighta bin kept mighta bin hood up."
HARRY_POTTER sank down next to a large bowl.
"what did you talk to HARRY_POTTER about, hagrid's ?
did you mention hogwarts at all?"
"mighta come up," said hagrid's , frowning as HARRY_POTTER tried to remember.
"yeah... HARRY_POTTER asked what i did, an' i told HARRY_POTTER i was gamekeeper here.... HARRY_POTTER asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after... so i told HARRY_POTTER... an' i said what i'd always really wanTED was a dragon... an' then...
i can' remember too well, 'cause HARRY_POTTER kept buyin' me drinks.... let's see... yeah, then HARRY_POTTER said HARRY_POTTER had the dragon egg an' we could play cards for an if i wanTED... but HARRY_POTTER had ter be sure i could handle an, HARRY_POTTER didn' want it ter go ter any old home....
so i told HARRY_POTTER, after FLUFFY, a dragon would be easy..."
    "and did HARRY_POTTER -- did HARRY_POTTER seem interesTED in FLUFFY?"
HARRY_POTTER asked, try ing to keep HARRY_POTTER voice calm.
"well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'YEH meet, even around hogwarts?
so i told HARRY_POTTER, FLUFFY's a piece o' cake if YEH know how to calm YEH  down, jus' play YEH  a bit o' music an' HARRY_POTTER'll go straight off ter sLEE_JORDANp --"
    hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
"i shouldn'ta told HARRY_POTTER that!"
HARRY_POTTER blurTED out.
"forget i said it!
hey -- where're YEH goin'?"
HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER, and HERMLONE  didn't speak to each other at all until "
    HARRY_POTTER, ron, and HERMLONE came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
"we've got to go to dumbledore," said HARRY_POTTER.
"hagrid's  told that stranger how to get past FLUFFY, and it was either SNAPE or VOLDEMORT under that clOAK -- it must've been easy, once he'd got hagrid's  drunk.
i just hope dumbledore believes we.
FIRENZE might back we up if BANE doesn't stop BANE.
where's dumbledore's office?"
they looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing they in the right direction.
they had never been told where dumbledorelived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see dumbledore.
"we'll just have to --HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.
"what are you three doing inside?"
it was professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, carrying a large pile of books.
"we want to see dumbledore," said HERMLONE, rather bravely, HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER thought.
"see dumbledore?"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL repeaTED, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
"why?HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER swallowed -- now what?
"it's sort of secret," HARRY_POTTER said, but HARRY_POTTER wished at once HARRY_POTTER hadn't, because professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's nostrils flared.
"dumbledore left ten minutes ago," dumbledore said coldly.
"dumbledore received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for lonDON at once."
"dumbledore's gone?"
said HARRY_POTTER frantically.
"now?"
"dumbledore is a very great wizard, POTTER, dumbledore has many demands on dumbledore time --
    "but this is important."
"something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic, POTTER.
"look," said HARRY_POTTER, throwing caution to the winds, "professor -- it's about the sorcerer's tone --"
    whatever professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had expecTED, it wasn't that.
the books professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was carrying tumbled out of professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL arms, but professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL didn't pick the books she was carrying up.
"how do you know --?"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL spluttered.
"professor, i think -- i know -- that sn- that someone's going to try and steal the sorcerer's stone.
i've got to talk to dumbledore."
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL eyed dumbledore with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
"dumbledore dumbledore will be back TOMorrow," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL said finally.
i DON't know how you found out about the sorcerer's stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal the sorcerer's stone, it's too well protecTED."
"but professor"
    "POTTER, i know what i'm talking about," professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL said shortly.
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL bent down and gathered up the books she was carrying.
i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine."
but they didn't.
"it's tonight," said HARRY_POTTER, once HARRY_POTTER was sure professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALLwas out of earshot.
"SNAPE's going through the trapdoor tonight.
SNAPE's found out everything SNAPE needs, and now SNAPE's got dumbledore out of the way.
SNAPE sent that note, i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up."
"but what can we --"
    HERMLONE  gasped.
HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER wheeled round.
SNAPE was standing there.
"good afternoon," SNAPE said smoothly.
HARRY_POTTER and ron stared at SNAPE.
"you shouldn't be inside on a day like this," SNAPE said, with an odd, twisTED smile.
"we were --HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER began, without any idea what HARRY_POTTER was going to say.
"you want to be more careful," said SNAPE.
"hanging around
    like this, people will think you're up to something.
and GRYFFINDOR really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?"
HARRY_POTTER flushed.
they turned to go outside, but SNAPE called they back.
"be warned, POTTER -- any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled.
good day to you."
HARRY_POTTER strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
out on the stone steps, HARRY_POTTER turned to the others.
"right, here's what we've got to do," HARRY_POTTER whispered urgently.
"one of we has got to keep an eye on SNAPE -- wait outside the staff room and follow SNAPE if SNAPE leaves the staff room.
HERMLONE, you'd better do that."
"why me?"
"it's obvious," said HARRY_POTTER.
"you can pretend to be waiting for professor FLITWICK, you know."
HARRY_POTTER put on a high voice, "'oh professor FLITWICK, i'm so worried, i think i got question fourteen b wrong....'"
    "oh, shut up," said HERMLONE , but HERMLONE  agreed to go and watch out for SNAPE.
"and we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," HARRY_POTTERtold HARRY_POTTER.
"come on."
but that part of the plan didn't work.
no sooner had they reached the door separating FLUFFY from the rest of the school than professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL turned up again and this time, professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL lost professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL temper.
"i suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL stormed.
"enough of this nonsense!
if i hear you 've come anywhere near here again, i'll take another fifty points from GRYFFINDOR!
yes, weasley, from my own house!"
HARRY_POTTER and ron went back to the common room, HARRY_POTTER had just said, "at least HERMLONE's on SNAPE's tail," when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and HERMLONE came in.
"i'm sorry, HARRY_POTTER!"
professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL wailed.
"SNAPE came out and asked me what i was doing, so i said i was waiting for professor FLITWICK, and SNAPE went to get SNAPE, and i've only just got away, i DON't know where SNAPE went."
"well, that's it then, isn't it?"
HARRY_POTTER said.
the other two stared at SNAPE.
SNAPE was pale and SNAPE eyes were glittering.
"i'm going out of here tonight and i'm going to try and get to the sorcerer's stone first."
"you're mad!"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"you can't!"
said HERMLONE .
"after what MINERVA_MCGONAGALL and SNAPE have said?
you'll be expelled!"
"so whapHARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER shouTED.
"DON't you understand?
if SNAPE gets hold of the sorcerer's stone, VOLDEMORT's coming back!
haven't you heard what it was like when SNAPE was trying to take over?
there won't be any hogwarts to get expelled from!
SNAPE'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the dark arts!
losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see?
d'you think d'you'll leave you and your families alone if GRYFFINDOR wins the house cup?
if i get caught before i can get to the sorcerer's stone, well, i'll have to go back to the DURSLEYS and wait for VOLDEMORT to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than i would have, because i'm never going over to the dark side!
i'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!
VOLDEMORT killed my parents, remember?"
VOLDEMORT glared at my parents.
"you're HARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER," said HERMLONE  in a small voice.
"i'll use the invisibility clOAK," said HARRY_POTTER.
"it's just lucky i got it back."
"but will it cover all three of us?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"all -- all three of us?"
"oh, come off it, you DON't think us'd let you go alone?"
"of course not," said HERMLONE  briskly.
"how do you think you'd get to the sorcerer's stone without us?
i'd better go and took through the books she was carrying, there might be something useful..."
    "but if us get caught, you two will be expelled, too."
"not if i can help it," said HERMLONE  grimly.
"professor FLITWICKtold me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on professor FLITWICK exam.
i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam're not throwing me out after that."
after dinner the three of i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam sat nervously apart in the common room.
nobody bothered i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam; none of the GRYFFINDORs had anything to say to HARRY_POTTER any more, after all.
this was the first night HARRY_POTTER hadn't been upset by this.
HERMLONE  was skimming through all HERMLONE  notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.
HARRY_POTTER and ron didn't talk much.
HARRY_POTTER and ron HARRY_POTTER and ron were thinking about what HARRY_POTTER and ron were about to do.
slowly, the common room emptied as people drifTED off to bed.
"better get the clOAK," HARRY_POTTER muttered, as LEE_JORDAN finally left, stretching and yawning.
HARRY_POTTER ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.
HARRY_POTTER putTED out the clOAK and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had GIVEN_HARRY for christmas.
HARRY_POTTER pockeTED the flute hagrid to use on FLUFFY -- HARRY_POTTER didn't feel much like singing.
HARRY_POTTER ran back down to the common room.
"we'd better put the clOAK on here, and make sure the clOAK covers all three of we -- if FILCH spots one of we feet wandering along on the clOAK own --"
    "what are you doing?"
said a voice from the corner of the common room.
MR._LONGBOTTOM appeared from behind an armchair, clutching TREVOR the toad, who looked as though MR._LONGBOTTOM'd been making another bid for freedom.
"nothing, MR._LONGBOTTOM, nothing," said HARRY_POTTER, hurriedly putting the clOAK behind HARRY_POTTER back.
MR._LONGBOTTOM stared at their guilty faces.
"you're going out again," MR._LONGBOTTOM said.
"no, no, no," said HERMLONE .
"no, we're not.
why DON't you go to bed, MR._LONGBOTTOM?"
HARRY_POTTER looked at the GRANdfather clock by the door.
their couldn't afford to waste any more time, SNAPE might even now be playing FLUFFY to sLEE_JORDANp.
"you can't go out," said MR._LONGBOTTOM, "you'll be caught again.
GRYFFINDOR will be in even more trouble."
"you DON't understand," said HARRY_POTTER, "this is important."
but MR._LONGBOTTOM was clearly steeling MR._LONGBOTTOM to do something desperate.
i won't let you do it," MR._LONGBOTTOM said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole.
"i'll -- i'll fight you!"
"MR._LONGBOTTOM, "HARRY_POTTER exploded, "get away from the portrait hole and DON't be an idiot --"
    "DON't you call me an idiot!"
said MR._LONGBOTTOM.
i DON't think you should be breaking any more rules!
and you were the one who told me to stand up to people!"
"yes, but not to us," said HARRY_POTTER in exasperation.
"MR._LONGBOTTOM, you DON't know what you're doing."
SNAPE took a step forward and MR._LONGBOTTOM dropped TREVOR the toad, who leapt out of sight.
"go on then, try and hit me!"
said MR._LONGBOTTOM, raising MR._LONGBOTTOM fists.
"i'm ready!HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER turned to HERMLONE .
"do something," MR._LONGBOTTOM said desperately.
HERMLONE  stepped forward.
MR._LONGBOTTOMMR._LONGBOTTOM," HERMLONE  said, "i'm really, really sorry about this."
HERMLONE  raised HERMLONE  wand.
"petrificus totalus!"
HERMLONE  cried, pointing it at MR._LONGBOTTOM.
MR._LONGBOTTOM's arms snapped to MR._LONGBOTTOM sides.
MR._LONGBOTTOM legs sprang together.
MR._LONGBOTTOM whole body rigid, MR._LONGBOTTOM swayed where MR._LONGBOTTOM stood and then fell flat on MR._LONGBOTTOM face, stiff as a board.
HERMLONE  ran to turn MR._LONGBOTTOM over.
MR._LONGBOTTOM's jaws were jammed together so MR._LONGBOTTOM couldn't speak.
only MR._LONGBOTTOM eyes were moving, looking at only his eyes in horror.
"what've you DONe to MR._LONGBOTTOM?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"it's the full body-bind," said HERMLONE  miserably.
"oh, MR._LONGBOTTOM, i'm so sorry."
"we had to, MR._LONGBOTTOM, no time to explain," said HARRY_POTTER.
"you'll understand later, MR._LONGBOTTOM," said HARRY_POTTER as they stepped over HARRY_POTTER and pulled on the invisibility clOAK.
but leaving MR._LONGBOTTOM lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen.
in they nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like FILCH, every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on they.
at the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotTED mrs. NORRIS skulking near the top.
"oh, let's kick mrs. NORRIS, just this once," HARRY_POTTER whispered in HARRY_POTTER's ear, but HARRY_POTTER shook HARRY_POTTER head.
as they climbed carefully around mrs. NORRIS, mrs. NORRIS turned mrs. NORRIS lamplike eyes on they, but didn't do anything.
they didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the floor.
peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.
"who's there?"
he said suddenly as they climbed toward he.
he narrowed he .
"know you're there, even if i can't see you.
are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
he rose up in the air and floaTED there, squinting at them.
"should call FILCH, i should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
HARRY_POTTER had a sudden idea.
"peeves," HARRY_POTTER said, in a hoarse whisper, "the bloody BARON has the bloody BARON own reasons for being invisible."
peeves almost fell out of the air in shock.
the bloody BARON caught the bloody BARON in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
"so sorry, your bloodiness, mr. BARON, sir," the bloody BARON said greasily.
"my mistake, my mistake -- i didn't see you -- of course i didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old PEEVSIE old PEEVSIE little joke, sir."
"i have business here, peeves," crOAKed HARRY_POTTER.
"stay away from this place tonight."
"i will, sir, i most certainly will," said peeves, rising up in the air again.
"hope your business goes well, the bloody BARON, i'll not bother you."
and the bloody BARON scooTED off
    "brilliant, HARRY_POTTER!"
whispered HARRY_POTTER.
a few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar.
"well, there you are,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER said quietly, "SNAPE's already got past FLUFFY."
seeing the door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of they what was facing they.
underneath the clOAK, HARRY_POTTER turned to the other two.
"if you want to go back, i won't blame you," HARRY_POTTER said.
"you can take the clOAK, i won't need the clOAK now."
"DON't be stupid," said HARRY_POTTER.
"we're coming," said HERMLONE .
HARRY_POTTER pushed the door open.
as the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears.
all three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see their.
"what's that at it feet?"
HERMLONE  whispered.
"looks like a harp," said HARRY_POTTER.
"SNAPE must have left it there."
"it must wake up the MOMent you stop playing," said HARRY_POTTER.
"well, here goes..."
    SNAPE put hagrid's flute to SNAPE lips and blew.
it wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop.
HARRY_POTTERhardly drew breath.
slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- the dog's growls tottered on the dog's growls PAWS and fell to the dog's growls knees, then the dog's growls slumped to the ground, fast asLEE_JORDANp.
"keep playing,HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER warned HARRY_POTTER as they slipped out of the clOAK and crept toward the trapdoor.
they could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.
"i think we'll be able to pull the door open," said HARRY_POTTER, peering over the dog's back.
"want to go first, HERMLONE ?"
"no, i DON't!"
"all right."
HARRY_POTTER gritTED HARRY_POTTER teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs.
HARRY_POTTER bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
"what can you see?"
HERMLONE  said anxiously.
"nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop."
HARRY_POTTER, who was still playing hagrid's flute, waved at HARRY_POTTER to get HARRY_POTTER attention and poinTED at HARRY_POTTER.
"you want to go first?
are you sure?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"i DON't know how deep this thing goes.
give hagrid's flute to HERMLONE  so HERMLONE  can keep HARRY_POTTER asLEE_JORDANp.HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER handed hagrid's flute over.
in the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the MOMent HERMLONE  began to play, the dog fell back into the dog deep sLEE_JORDANp.
HARRY_POTTER climbed over the dog and looked down through the trapdoor.
there was no sign of the botTOM.
HARRY_POTTER lowered HARRY_POTTER through the hole until HARRY_POTTER was hanging on by HARRY_POTTER fingertips.
then HARRY_POTTER looked up at HARRY_POTTER and said, "if anything happens to HARRY_POTTER, DON't follow.
go straight to the owlery and send HEDWIG to dumbledore, right?"
"right," said HARRY_POTTER.
"see you in a minute, i hope...
    and HARRY_POTTER let go.
cold, damp air rushed past HARRY_POTTER as HARRY_POTTER fell down, down, down and -- flump.
with a funny, muffled sort of thump HARRY_POTTER landed on something soft.
HARRY_POTTER sat up and felt around, HARRY_POTTER eyes not used to the gloom.
his eyes  felt as though HARRY_POTTER was sitting on some sort of plant.
"it's okay!"
HARRY_POTTER called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
HARRY_POTTER followed right away. "
ron landed, sprawled next to HARRY_POTTER.
"what's this stuff?"
were "
    ron first words.
"dunno, some sort of plant thing.
i suppose it's here to break the fall.
come on, HERMLONE !"
the distant music stopped.
there was a loud bark from the dog, but HERMLONE  had already jumped.
HERMLONE  landed on HARRY_POTTER's other side.
"we must be miles under the school , HERMLONE  said.
"lucky this plant thing's here, really," said HARRY_POTTER.
"lucky!"
shrieked HERMLONE .
"look at you both!"
HERMLONE  leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall.
HERMLONE  had to struggle because the MOMent HERMLONE  had landed, plant had starTED to twist snakelike tendrils around HERMLONE  ankles.
as for HARRY_POTTER and HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER and ron legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without HARRY_POTTER and ron noticing.
HERMLONE  had managed to free HERMLONE  before plant got a firm grip on HERMLONE .
now HERMLONE  watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull plant off them, but the more them strained against the, the tighter and faster plant wound around them.
"stop moving!"
HERMLONE  ordered them.
"i know what this is -- it's DEVIL's snare!"
"oh, i'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled HARRY_POTTER, leaning back, trying to stop plant from curling around HARRY_POTTER neck.
"shut up, i'm trying to remember how to kill it!"
said HERMLONE .
"well, hurry up, i can't breathe!"
HARRY_POTTER gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around HARRY_POTTER chest.
"DEVIL's snare, DEVIL's snare... what did professor sprout say?
-- professor sprout  likes the dark and the damp
    "so light a fire!"
HARRY_POTTER choked.
"yes -- of course -- but there's no WOOD!"
HERMLONE  cried, wringing HERMLONE  hands.
"have you gone mad?"
HARRY_POTTER CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed.
"are you a witch or not?"
"oh, right!"
said HERMLONE , and HERMLONE  whipped out her wand, waved her wand, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same blueCHASER_KATIE_BELL flames HERMLONE  had used on SNAPE at plant.
in a matter of seconds, the two boys felt professor sprout  loosening professor sprout  grip as professor sprout  cringed away from the light and warmth.
wriggling and flailing, professor sprout  unraveled professor sprout  from wriggling and flailing bodies, and wriggling and flailing were able to pull free.
"lucky you pay attention in herbology, HERMLONE," said HARRY_POTTERas HARRY_POTTER joined HERMLONE  by the wall, wiping sweat off HARRY_POTTER face.
"yeah," said HARRY_POTTER, "and HARRY_POTTER HARRY_POTTER doesn't lose HARRY_POTTER head in a crisis -- 'there's no WOOD,' honestly."
"this way," said HARRY_POTTER, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
all they could hear apart from they footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls.
the passageway sloped downward, and HARRY_POTTER was reminded of GRINGOTTS.
with an unpleasant jolt of the heart, HARRY_POTTER remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.
if the dragons met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- NORBERT had been bad enough...
    "can you hear something?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
HARRY_POTTER listened.
a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.
"do you think it's a ghost?"
"i DON't know... sounds like wings to HARRY_POTTER."
"there's light ahead -- i can see something moving."
the dragons reached the end of the passageway and saw before the dragons a brilliantly lit chamber, a brilliantly lit chamber ceiling arching high above the dragons.
a brilliantly lit chamber was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room.
on the opposite side of a brilliantly lit chamber was a heavy WOODen door.
"do you think they'll attack us if us cross the room?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"probably," said HARRY_POTTER.
"they DON't look very vicious, but i suppose if they swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice...
i'll run."
HARRY_POTTER took a deep breath, covered HARRY_POTTER face with HARRY_POTTER arms, and sprinTED across the room.
HARRY_POTTER expecTED to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at HARRY_POTTER any second, but nothing happened.
HARRY_POTTER reached a heavy WOODen door.
HARRY_POTTER pulled the handle, but the handle was locked.
the other two followed HARRY_POTTER.
they tugged and heaved at a heavy WOODen door, but the handle wouldn't budge, not even when HERMLONE  tried HERMLONE  alohomora charm.
"now what?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"these birds...
these birds can't be here just for decoration," said HERMLONE .
these birds watched these birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?
"these birds're not birds!"
HARRY_POTTER said suddenly.
"these birds're keys!
winged keys -- look carefully.
so that must mean..." HARRY_POTTER looked around a brilliantly lit chamber while the other two squinTED up at the flock of keys.
"... yes -- look!
broomsticks!
we've got to catch the key to a heavy WOODen door!"
"but there are hundreds of them!"
ron examined the lock on a heavy WOODen door.
"we're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle."
they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys.
they grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darTED and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.
not for nothing, though, was HARRY_POTTER the youngest seeker in a century.
HARRY_POTTER the youngest seeker  had a knack for spotting things other people didn't.
after a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, HARRY_POTTER the youngest seeker  noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if a large silver key that had a bent wing had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
"that one!"
HARRY_POTTER the youngest seeker  called to the others.
"that big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
ron went speeding in the direction that HARRY_POTTER was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off HARRY_POTTER broom.
"we've got to close in on it!"
HARRY_POTTER called, not taking HARRY_POTTER eyes off a large silver key that had a bent wing with a bent wing.
"HARRY_POTTER, you come at it from above -- HERMLONE , stay below and stop it from going down and i'll try and catch it.
right, now!"
ron dived, HERMLONE  rockeTED upward, a large silver key that had a bent wing dodged them both, and HARRY_POTTER streaked after a large silver key that had a bent wing; a large silver key that had a bent wing sped toward the wall, HARRY_POTTER leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned a large silver key that had a bent wing against the stone with one hand.
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE 's cheers echoed around a brilliantly lit chamber.
ron and HERMLONE's cheers landed quickly, and HARRY_POTTER ran to the door, the key struggling in one hand.
HARRY_POTTER rammed a brilliantly lit chamber into the lock and turned -- a brilliantly lit chamber worked.
the MOMent the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that flight  had been caught twice.
"ready?"
HARRY_POTTER asked the other two, HARRY_POTTER hand on the doorhandle.
ron and HERMLONE's cheers nodded.
HARRY_POTTER pulled the door open.
a brilliantly lit chamber was so dark ron and HERMLONE's cheers couldn't see anything at all.
but as ron and HERMLONE's cheers stepped into a brilliantly lit chamber, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
ron and HERMLONE's cheers were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than ron and HERMLONE's cheers were and carved from what looked like black stone.
facing ron and HERMLONE's cheers, way across a brilliantly lit chamber, were the white pieces.
HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.
"now what do we do?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"it's obvious, isn't it?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"we've got to play we way across the room ."
behind the white pieces the white pieces could see another door.
"how?"
said HERMLONE  nervously.
"i think," said HARRY_POTTER, "we're going to have to be chessmen."
HARRY_POTTER walked up to a black knight and put HARRY_POTTER hand out to touch a black knight's horse.
at once, black stone sprang to life.
the knight's horsepawed the ground and a black knight turned the knight's horse helmeTED head to look down at HARRY_POTTER.
"do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?"
a black knight nodded.
HARRY_POTTER turned to the other two.
"this needs thinking about HARRY_POTTER said.
i suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...."
    HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE stayed quiet, watching HARRY_POTTER think.
finally HARRY_POTTER said, "now, DON't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --"
    "we're not offended," said HARRY_POTTER quickly.
"just tell we what to do."
"well, HARRY_POTTER, you take the place of that bishop, and HERMLONE, you 90 next to HARRY_POTTER instead of that castle."
"what about you?"
"i'm going to be a knight," said HARRY_POTTER.
the chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned a knight, a bishop, and a castle backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER, and HERMLONE  took.
"white always plays first in chess," said HARRY_POTTER, peering across the board.
"yes... look..."
    a white pawn had moved forward two squares.
HARRY_POTTER starTED to direct the white pieces.
the white pieces moved silently wherever HARRY_POTTER sent the white pieces.
HARRY_POTTER's knees were trembling.
what if the white pieces lost?
"HARRY_POTTER -- move diagonally four squares to the right."
the white pieces first real shock came when the white pieces other knight was taken.
the white queen smashed HARRY_POTTER to the floor and dragged HARRY_POTTER off the board, where HARRY_POTTER lay quite still, facedown.
"had to let that happen," said HARRY_POTTER, looking shaken.
"leaves you free to take that bishop, HERMLONE, go on."
every time one of that bishop, HERMLONE men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.
twice, HARRY_POTTER only just noticed in time that HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE  were in danger.
HARRY_POTTER darTED around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE had lost black ones.
"we're nearly there," HARRY_POTTER muttered suddenly.
"let me think let me think..."
    the white queen turned "
    the white queen blank face toward HARRY_POTTER.
"yes..." said HARRY_POTTER softly, "it's the only way...
i've got to be taken."
". "
HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE shouTED.
"that's chess!"
snapped HARRY_POTTER.
"you've got to make some sacrifices!
i take one step forward and "
    the white queen'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, HARRY_POTTER!"
"but --"
    "do you want to stop SNAPE or not?"
"HARRY_POTTER --"
    "look, if you DON't hurry up, SNAPE'll already have black stone!"
there was no alternative.
"ready?"
HARRY_POTTER called, HARRY_POTTER face pale but determined.
"here i go - now, DON't hang around once you've won."
SNAPE stepped forward, and the white queen pounced.
the white queen struck HARRY_POTTER hard across the head with the white queen stone arm, and SNAPE crashed to the floor - HERMLONE screamed but stayed on the white queen square - the white queen dragged HARRY_POTTER to one side.
SNAPE looked as if SNAPE'd been knocked out.
shaking, HARRY_POTTER moved three spaces to the left.
the white king took off the white king crown and threw his crown at HARRY_POTTER's feet.
they had won.
the chessmen parTED and bowed, leaving the doorahead clear.
with one last desperate look back at HARRY_POTTER, HARRY_POTTER and HERMLONE charged through the door and up the next passageway.
"what if SNAPE's --?"
"SNAPE'll be all right," said HARRY_POTTER, trying to convince SNAPE.
"what do you reckon's next?"
"we've had sprout's, that was the DEVIL's snare; FLITWICK must've put charms on the keys; MINERVA_MCGONAGALL transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves QUIRTELL's spell, and SNAPE's."
them had reached another door.
"all right?"
HARRY_POTTER whispered.
"go on.HARRY_POTTER's  pushed it open.
a disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of their pull both of them  robes up over both of them  noses.
eyes watering, both of them  saw, flat on the floor in front of both of them , a troll even larger than the one both of them  had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on the one they had tackled head.
"i'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," HARRY_POTTER whispered as both of them  stepped carefully over one of that one massive legs.
"come on, i can't breathe."
HARRY_POTTER pulled open another door, both of both of them  hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
"SNAPE's," said HARRY_POTTER.
"what do we have to do?"
both of them stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind both of them in the doorway.
it wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple.
at the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.
black flames were trapped.
"look!"
HERMLONE  seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
HARRY_POTTER looked over HARRY_POTTER shoulder to read her shoulder:
    danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
    two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
    one among us seven will let you move ahead,
    another will transport the drinker back instead,
    two among us number hold only nettle wine,
    three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
    to help you in your choice, us give you these clues four:
    first, however slyly the poison tries to hide
    you will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
    second, different are those who stand at either end,
    but if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
    third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
    neither dwarf nor giant holds death in dwarf nor giant insides;
    fourth, the second left and the second on the right
    are twins once you taste twins, though different at first sight.
HERMLONE  let out a great sigh and HARRY_POTTER, amazed, saw that HERMLONE
was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
"brilliant," said HERMLONE .
"this isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
a lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, a lot of the greatest wizards'd be stuck in here forever."
"but so will us, won't us?"
"of course not," said HERMLONE .
"everything us need is here on this paper.
seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple."
"but how do us know which to drink?"
"give me a minute."
HERMLONE read this paper several times.
then "
    HERMLONE walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to "
    HERMLONE and pointing at them.
at last, "
    HERMLONE clapped "
    HERMLONE hands.
"got it," "
    HERMLONE said.
"the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward black stone.HARRY_POTTER's  looked at the smallest bottle.
"there's only enough there for one of us," HARRY_POTTER's  said.
"that's hardly one swallow."
they looked at each other.
"which one will get you back through the purple flames?"
HERMLONE poinTED at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
"you drink that," said HARRY_POTTER.
"no, listen, get back and get HARRY_POTTER.
grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past FLUFFY -- go straight to the owlery and send HEDWIG to dumbledore, we need dumbledore.
i might be able to hold SNAPE off for a while, but i'm no match for SNAPE , really."
"but HARRY_POTTER's  what if YOU-KNOW-who's with SNAPE ?"
"well -- i was lucky once, wasn't i?"
said HARRY_POTTER, pointing at HARRY_POTTER scar.
"i might get lucky again."
HERMLONE's lip trembled, and "
    HERMLONE suddenly dashed at HARRY_POTTER and threw "
    HERMLONE arms around HARRY_POTTER.
"HERMLONE!"
"HARRY_POTTER -- you're a great wizard, you know."
"i'm not as good as HARRY_POTTER," said HARRY_POTTER, very embarrassed, as "
    HERMLONE let go of HARRY_POTTER.
"me!"
said HERMLONE .
"books!
and cleverness!
there are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh HARRY_POTTER -- be careful!"
"you drink first," said HARRY_POTTER.
"you are sure which is which, aren't you?"
"positive," said HERMLONE .
HERMLONE  took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
"it's not poison?"
said HARRY_POTTER anxiously.
"no -- but it's like ice."
"quick, go, before it wears off."
"good luck -- take care."
"go!"
HERMLONE turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
HARRY_POTTER took a deep breath and picked up the round bottle.
HARRY_POTTER turned to face the black flames.
"here i come," HARRY_POTTER said, and HARRY_POTTER drained the round bottle in one gulp.
it was indeed as though ice was flooding HARRY_POTTER body.
HARRY_POTTER put the round bottle down and walked forward; HARRY_POTTER braced HARRY_POTTER, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel the black flames -- for a MOMent HARRY_POTTER could see nothing but dark fire -- then HARRY_POTTER was on the other side, in the last chamber.
there was already someone there -- but it wasn't SNAPE.
it wasn't even VOLDEMORT.
chapter seventeen.
the man with two faces.
it was QUIRTELL.
"you!"
gasped HARRY_POTTER.
QUIRTELL smiled.
QUIRTELL face wasn't twitching at all.
"me," QUIRTELL said calmly.
"i wondered whether i'd be meeting you here, POTTER."
"but i thought -- SNAPE --"
    "SEVERUS_SNAPE?"
QUIRTELL laughed, and QUIRTELL wasn't QUIRTELL usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
"yes, SEVERUS_SNAPE does seem the type, doesn't SEVERUS_SNAPE?
so useful to have SEVERUS_SNAPE swooping around like an overgrown bat.
next to SEVERUS_SNAPE, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering p-professor QUIRTELL?HARRY_POTTER's  couldn't take it in.
this couldn't be true, it couldn't.
"but SNAPE tried to kill me!"
"no, no, no.
i tried to kill you.
your friend MR._GRANGER accidentally knocked me over as your friend MR._GRANGER  rushed to set fire to SNAPE at that quidditch match.
your friend MR._GRANGER  broke my eye contact with you.
another few seconds and i'd have got you off that broom.
i'd have managed that broom before then if SNAPE hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
"SNAPE was trying to save me?"
"of course," said QUIRTELL coolly.
"\why do you think SNAPE wanTED to referee your next match?
SNAPE was trying to make sure i didn't do it again.
funny, really... SNAPE needn't have bothered.
i couldn't do anything with dumbledore watching.
all the other teachers thought SNAPE was trying to stop GRYFFINDOR from winning, SNAPE did make SNAPE unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, i'm going to kill you tonight.QUIRTELL snapped QUIRTELL fingers.
ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped ropes tightly around HARRY_POTTER.
"you're too nosy to live, POTTER.
scurrying around the school on halloween like that, for all i knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding black stone."
"you let the troll in?"
"certainly.
i have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there?
unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, SNAPE, who already suspecTED me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did the troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite SNAPE's leg off properly.
"now, wait quietly, POTTER.
i need to examine this interesting mirror.
this interesting mirror was only then that HARRY_POTTER realized what was standing behindQUIRTELL.
it was the mirror of erised.
"the mirror of erised is the key to finding black stone,QUIRTELL QUIRTELL murmured, tapping QUIRTELL way around the frame.
"trust dumbledore to come up with something like this... but trust dumbledore to come up with something like this...'s in lonDON...
i'll be far away by the time trust dumbledore to come up with something like this... gets back...."
    HARRY_POTTER's  could think of doing was to keep QUIRTELL talking and stop trust dumbledore to come up with something like this... from concentrating on the mirror of erised.
"i saw you and SNAPE in the forest --" SNAPE blurTED out.
"yes," said QUIRTELL idly, walking around the mirror of erised to look at the back.
"SNAPE was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far i'd got.
SNAPE suspecTED me all along.
tried to frighten me - as though SNAPE could, when i had lord VOLDEMORT on my side....QUIRTELL came back out from behind the mirror of erised and stared hungrily into the mirror of erised.
"i see black stone...
i'm presenting black stone to master... but where is black stone?HARRY_POTTER's  struggled against the ropes binding HARRY_POTTER's , but they didn't give.
HARRY_POTTER's  had to keep QUIRTELL from giving HARRY_POTTER's  whole attention to the mirror of erised.
"but SNAPE always seemed to hate me so much."
"oh, SNAPE does," said QUIRTELL casually, "heavens, yes.
SNAPE was at hogwarts with your father, didn't you know?
they loathed each other.
but SNAPE never wanTED you dead."
"but i heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- i thought SNAPEwas threatening you...."
    for the first time, a spasm of fear flitTED across QUIRTELLface.
"sometimes," SNAPE said, "i find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- SNAPE is a great wizard and i am weak --"
    "you mean SNAPE was there in the classroom with you?"
HARRY_POTTER gasped.
"SNAPE is with me wherever i go," said QUIRTELL quietly.
"i met SNAPE when i traveled around the world.
a foolish young man i was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil.
lord VOLDEMORT showed me how wrong i was.
there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek evil....
since then, i have served SNAPE faithfully, although i have let SNAPE down many times.
SNAPE has had to be very hard on me."
QUIRTELL shivered suddenly.
"SNAPE does not forgive mistakes easily.
when i failed to steal black stone from GRINGOTTS, SNAPE was most displeased.
SNAPE punished me... decided SNAPE would have to keep a closer watch on SNAPE....QUIRTELL's voice trailed away.
HARRY_POTTER was remembering HARRY_POTTER trip to DIAGON_ALLEY -how could HARRY_POTTER have been so stupid?
HARRY_POTTER'd seen QUIRTELL that very day, shaken hands with HARRY_POTTER in the leaky cauldron.
QUIRTELL cursed under QUIRTELL breath.
"i DON't understand... is black stonethe mirror of erised?
should i break it?"
HARRY_POTTER's mind was racing.
what i want more than anything else in the world at the MOMent, HARRY_POTTER thought, is to find black stone before QUIRTELL does.
so if i look in the mirror of erised, i should see myseff finding it -- which means i'll see where it's hidden!
but how can i look without QUIRTELLrealizing what i'm up to?
HARRY_POTTER tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without QUIRTELL noticing, but the ropes around HARRY_POTTER ankles were too tight: HARRY_POTTER tripped and fell over.
QUIRTELL ignored HARRY_POTTER.
QUIRTELL was still talking to QUIRTELL.
"what does the mirror of erised do?
how does the mirror of erised work?
help me, master!"
and to HARRY_POTTER's horror, a voice answered, and a voice seemed to come from QUIRTELL himself
    "use the boy... use the boy...QUIRTELL rounded on HARRY_POTTER.
"yes -- POTTER -- come here."
HARRY_POTTER clapped HARRY_POTTER hands once, and the ropes binding HARRY_POTTER fell off.
HARRY_POTTER got slowly to HARRY_POTTER feet.
"come here,QUIRTELL QUIRTELL repeaTED.
"look in the mirror of erised and tell me what you see.HARRY_POTTER's  walked toward HARRY_POTTER's .
i must lie, HARRY_POTTER's  thought desperately.
i must look and lie about what i see, that's all.
QUIRTELL moved close behind HARRY_POTTER's .
HARRY_POTTER breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from QUIRTELL's turban.
HARRY_POTTER closed HARRY_POTTER eyes, stepped in front of the mirror of erised, and opened them again.
HARRY_POTTER saw HARRY_POTTER reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.
but a MOMent later, the reflection smiled at HARRY_POTTER.
the reflection put the reflection hand into the reflection pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone.
the reflection winked and put black stone back in its pocket -- and as black stone did so, HARRY_POTTER felt something heavy drop into its pocket.
somehow -- incredibly -- HARRY_POTTER'd gotten black stone.
"well?"
said QUIRTELL impatiently.
"what do you see?HARRY_POTTER's  screwed up HARRY_POTTER's  courage.
"i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore," dumbledore invenTED.
"i -- i've won the house cup for GRYFFINDOR.QUIRTELL cursed again.
"get out of the way," dumbledore said.
as HARRY_POTTER moved aside, dumbledore felt the sorcerer's stone against dumbledore leg.
dare dumbledore make a break for it?
but dumbledore hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though QUIRTELL wasn't moving dumbledore lips.
"dumbledore lies... dumbledore lies..."
    "POTTER, come back here!"
QUIRTELL shouTED.
"tell me the truth!
what did you just see?"
the high voice spoke again.
"let me speak to dumbledore... face-to-face..."
    "master, you are not strong enough!"
"i have strength enough... for this....HARRY_POTTER's  felt as if DEVIL's snare was rooting DEVIL's snare to the spot.
DEVIL's snare couldn't move a muscle.
petrified, DEVIL's snare watched as QUIRTELL reached up and began to unwrap DEVIL's snare .
what was going on?
the QUIRTELL's turbanfell away.
QUIRTELL's head looked strangely small without QUIRTELL.
then QUIRTELL's head turned slowly on the spot.
HARRY_POTTER would have screamed, but HARRY_POTTER couldn't make a sound.
where there should have been a back to QUIRTELL's head, there was a face, the most terrible face HARRY_POTTER had ever seen.
it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
"HARRY_POTTER..." it whispered.
HARRY_POTTER tried to take a step backward but HARRY_POTTER legs wouldn't move.
"see what i have become?"
a face, the most terrible face HARRY_POTTER had ever seen said.
"mere shadow and vapor ...
i have form only when i can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw QUIRTELL QUIRTELL drinking unicorn blood for me in the forest... and once i have the elixir of life, i will be able to create a body of my own.... now... why DON't you give me that black stone in your pocket?"
so stone in your pocket knew.
the feeling suddenly surged back into HARRY_POTTER's legs.
stone in your pocket stumbled backward.
"DON't be a fool," snarled the face.
"better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... your parents died begging me for mercy..."
    "liar!"
HARRY_POTTER shouTED suddenly.
QUIRTELL was walking backward at HARRY_POTTER, so that lord VOLDEMORT could still see HARRY_POTTER.
the face was now smiling.
"how touching..." it hissed.
"i always value bravery...
yes, boy, your parents were brave....
i killed your father first; and your father put up a courageous fight... but your MOTHER needn't have died... your MOTHER was trying to protect you.... now give me black stone, unless you want your MOTHER to have died in vain."
"never!HARRY_POTTER's  sprang toward the flame door, but lord VOLDEMORT screamed "seize him!"
and the next second, HARRY_POTTER felt QUIRTELL's hand close on HARRY_POTTER wrist.
at once, a needle-sharp pain seared across HARRY_POTTER's scar; HARRY_POTTER head felt as though it was about to split in two; HARRY_POTTER yelled, struggling with all HARRY_POTTER might, and to HARRY_POTTER surprise, QUIRTELL let go of HARRY_POTTER.
the pain in his head lessened -- HARRY_POTTER looked around wildly to see where QUIRTELL had gone, and saw HARRY_POTTER hunched in pain, looking at HARRY_POTTER fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.
"seize HARRY_POTTER!
seize HARRY_POTTER!"
shrieked lord VOLDEMORT again, and QUIRTELLlunged, knocking HARRY_POTTER clean off QUIRTELL feet' landing on top of QUIRTELL, both hands around HARRY_POTTER's neck -- HARRY_POTTER's scar was almost blinding HARRY_POTTER with pain, yet HARRY_POTTER could see QUIRTELL howling in agony.
"master, i cannot hold HARRY_POTTER -- my hands -- my hands!"
and QUIRTELL, though pinning HARRY_POTTER to the ground with HARRY_POTTER knees, let go of HARRY_POTTER neck and stared, bewildered, at HARRY_POTTER own palms -- HARRY_POTTER could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
"then kill HARRY_POTTER, fool, and be DONe!"
screeched lord VOLDEMORT.
QUIRTELL raised QUIRTELL hand to perform a deadly curse, but HARRY_POTTER, by instinct, reached up and grabbed QUIRTELL's face --
    "aaaargh!QUIRTELL rolled off QUIRTELL, QUIRTELL face blistering, too, and then HARRY_POTTER knew: QUIRTELL couldn't touch HARRY_POTTER bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- HARRY_POTTER only chance was to keep hold of QUIRTELL, keep HARRY_POTTER in enough pain to stop HARRY_POTTER from doing a curse.
HARRY_POTTER jumped to his feet, caught QUIRTELL by the arm, and hung on as tight as HARRY_POTTER could.
QUIRTELL screamed and tried to throw HARRY_POTTERoff -- the pain in HARRY_POTTER's head was building -- HARRY_POTTER couldn't see -- HARRY_POTTER could only hear QUIRTELL's terrible shrieks and VOLDEMORT's yells of, "kill him!
kill him!"
and other voices, maybe in HARRY_POTTER's own head, crying, HARRY_POTTERHARRY_POTTER!
HARRY_POTTER!"
HARRY_POTTER felt QUIRTELL's arm wrenched from HARRY_POTTER grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down...
    something gold was glinting just above HARRY_POTTER.
the snitch!
HARRY_POTTER tried to catch it, but HARRY_POTTER arms were too heavy.
HARRY_POTTER blinked.
it wasn't the snitch at all.
it was a pair of glasses.
how strange.
HARRY_POTTER blinked again.
the smiling face of dumbledore swam into view above ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE swam .
"good afternoon, HARRY_POTTER," said dumbledore.
HARRY_POTTER stared at dumbledore.
then HARRY_POTTER remembered: "sir!
black stone!
it was QUIRTELL!
HARRY_POTTER's got black stone!
"sir, quick --"
    "calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said dumbledore.
"QUIRTELL does not have black stone."
"then who does?
sir, i --"
    "HARRY_POTTER, please relax, or MADAM_POMFTEY will have me thrown out.
HARRY_POTTER swallowed and looked around HARRY_POTTER.
HARRY_POTTER realized HARRY_POTTER must be in the hospital wing.
HARRY_POTTER was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to HARRY_POTTER was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
"tokens from your friends and admirers," said dumbledore, beaming.
"what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor QUIRTELL is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.
i believe your friends misters FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.
no doubt your friends misters FRED_WEASLEY and GEORGE_WEASLEY  thought it would amuse you.
MADAM_POMFTEY, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscaTED it."
"how long have i been in here?"
"three days.
mr. RONALD_WEASLEY and MR._GRANGER will be most relieved you have come round, mr. RONALD_WEASLEY and MR._GRANGER have been extremely worried."
"but sit, black stonei see you are not to be distracTED.
very well, the stone.
QUIRTELL did not manage to take QUIRTELL from black stone.
i arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, i must say.
"you got there?
you got HERMLONE's owl?"
"we must have crossed in midair.
no sooner had i reached lonDON than lonDON  became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left.
i arrived just in time to pull QUIRTELL off black stone."
"it was you."
"i feared i might be too late."
"you nearly were, i couldn't have kept QUIRTELL off black stone much longer --"
    "not the stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you.
for one terrible MOMent there, i was afraid black stone had.
as forblack stoneblack stone, black stone has been destroyed."
"destroyed?"
said HARRY_POTTER blankly.
"but your friend -- MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel --"
    "oh, you know about MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel?"
said dumbledore, sounding quite delighTED.
"you did do the thing properly, didn't you?
well, MR._DUMBLEDORE flameland i have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
"but that means MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel and MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel wife will die, won't he and his wife?"
"he and his wife have enough elixir stored to set he and his wife affairs in order and then, yes, he and his wife will die."
dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on HARRY_POTTER's face.
"to one as young as you, i'm sure it seems incredible, but to MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel and PERENELLE, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day.
after all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
you know, black stone black stone was really not such a wonderful thing.
as much money and life as you could want!
the two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for humans."
HARRY_POTTER lay there, lost for words.
dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.
"sir?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"i've been thinking... sir -- even if black stoneblack stone's gone, vol-, i mean, YOU-KNOW- who --"
    "call him VOLDEMORT, HARRY_POTTER.
always use the proper name for things.
fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."
"yes, "sir.
well, lord VOLDEMORT's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't lord VOLDEMORT?
i mean, lord VOLDEMORT hasn't gone, has lord VOLDEMORT?"
"no, HARRY_POTTER, lord VOLDEMORT has not.
lord VOLDEMORT is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, lord VOLDEMORT cannot be killed.
lord VOLDEMORT left QUIRTELL to die; lord VOLDEMORT shows just as little mercy to lord VOLDEMORT followers as lord VOLDEMORT enemies.
nevertheless, HARRY_POTTER, while you may only have delayed lord VOLDEMORT return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if lord VOLDEMORT is delayed again, and again, why, lord VOLDEMORT may never return to power.HARRY_POTTER's  nodded, but stopped quickly, because HARRY_POTTER's  made lord VOLDEMORT head hurt.
then HARRY_POTTER's  said, ".
"sir, there are some other things i'd like to know, if you can tell me... things i want to know the truth about...."
    "the truth ."
dumbledore sighed.
"it is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treaTED with great caution.
however, i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to, in which case i beg you'll forgive me.
i shall not, of course, lie."
"well... lord VOLDEMORT said that lord VOLDEMORT only killed my MOTHER because my MOTHER tried to stop lord VOLDEMORT from killing me.
but why would lord VOLDEMORT want to kill me in the first place?"
dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
"alas, the first thing you ask me, i cannot tell you.
not today.
not now.
you will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, HARRY_POTTER.
when you are older...
i know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know."
and HARRY_POTTER knew it would be no good to argue.
"but why couldn't QUIRTELL touch me?"
"my MOTHER died to save you.
if there is one thing lord VOLDEMORT cannot understand, it is love.
VOLDEMORT  didn't realize love as powerful as my MOTHER's for you leaves powerful own mark.
not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.
it is in your very skin.
QUIRTELL, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing QUIRTELL soul with lord VOLDEMORT, could not touch you for this reason.
it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good."
dumbledore now became very interesTED in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave HARRY_POTTER time to dry HARRY_POTTER eyes on the sheet.
when HARRY_POTTER had found HARRY_POTTER voice again, HARRY_POTTER said, "and the invisibility clOAK - do you know who sent his voice to HARRY_POTTER?"
"ah - your father happened to leave his voice in my possession, and i thought you might like his voice."
dumbledore's eyes twinkled.
"useful things... your father used his voice mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when your father was here."
"and there's something else..."
    "fire away."
"QUIRTELL said SNAPE --"
    "professor SNAPE, HARRY_POTTER."
"yes, professor SNAPE, HARRY_POTTER."
-- QUIRTELL said professor SNAPE, HARRY_POTTER."
hates me because professor SNAPE, HARRY_POTTER."
haTED your father.
is that true?"
"well, they did rather detest each other.
not unlike yourself and mr. MALFOY.
and then, your father did something SNAPE could never forgive."
"what?"
"your father saved your father life."
"what?"
"yes..." said dumbledore dreamily.
"funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it?
SNAPE couldn't bear being in your father's debt....
i do believe SNAPE worked so hard to protect you this year because SNAPE felt that would make SNAPE and your father even.
then SNAPE could go back to hating your father's memory in peace....HARRY_POTTER's  tried to understand this but this made HARRY_POTTER's  head pound, so HARRY_POTTER's  stopped.
"and "sir, there's one more thing..."
    "just the one?"
"how did i get black stone out of the mirror?"
"ah, now, i'm glad you asked me that.
it was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something.
you see, only one who wanTED to find black stone -- find black stone, but not use black stone -- would be able to get black stone, otherwise they'd just see they making gold or drinking elixir of life.
my brain surprises even me sometimes.... now, enough questions.
i suggest you make a start on these sweets.
ah!
BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans!
i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then i'm afraid i've rather lost my liking for them -- but i think i'll be safe with a nice toffee, DON't you?"
he smiled and popped the golden-BROWN bean into he mouth.
then he choked and said, "alas!
ear wax!"
MADAM_POMFTEY, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
"just five minutes," HARRY_POTTER pleaded.
"absolutely not."
"you let "
    dumbledore in..."
    "well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different.
you need rest."
"i am resting, look, lying down and everything.
oh, go on, MADAM_POMFTEY..."
    "oh, very well," MADAM_POMFTEY said.
"but five minutes only."
and MADAM_POMFTEY let ron and HERMLONE in.
"HARRY_POTTER!"
HERMLONE looked ready to fling "
    HERMLONE arms around "
    HERMLONE again, but HARRY_POTTER was glad "
    HERMLONE held "
    HERMLONE in as HARRY_POTTER head was still very sore.
"oh, HARRY_POTTER, we were sure you were going to -- dumbledore was so worried --"
    "the whole school's talking about it," said ron.
"what really happened?"
it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors.
HARRY_POTTER told them everything: QUIRTELL; the mirror; the stone; and VOLDEMORT.
ron and HERMLONE were a very good audience; ron and HERMLONE gasped in all the right places, and when HARRY_POTTER told ron and HERMLONE what was under QUIRTELL's turban, "
    HERMLONE screamed out loud.
"so black stoneblack stone's gone?"
said ron finally.
"flamel's just going to die?"
"that's what i said, but dumbledore thinks that -- what was it?
-- 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
"i always said dumbledore was off dumbledore rocker," said ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy dumbledore hero was.
"so what happened to ron two?"
said HARRY_POTTER.
"well, i got back all right," said "
    HERMLONE.
"i brought ronround -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met ron in the entrance hall -- ron already knew -- ron just said, 'HARRY_POTTER's gone after ron, hasn't HARRY_POTTER?'
and hurtled off to the third floor."
"d'you think HARRY_POTTER meant you to do d'you?"
said ron.
"sending you your father's clOAK and everything?"
"well, " "
    HERMLONE exploded, "if HARRY_POTTER did -- i mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed."
"no, it isn't," said HARRY_POTTER thoughtfully.
"HARRY_POTTER's a funny man, dumbledore.
i think HARRY_POTTER sort of wanTED to give me a chance.
i think HARRY_POTTER knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know.
i reckon HARRY_POTTER had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping we, HARRY_POTTER just taught we enough to help.
i DON't think it was an accident HARRY_POTTER let me find out how the mirror worked.
it's almost like HARRY_POTTER thought i had the right to face lord VOLDEMORT if i could...."
    "yeah, dumbledore's off dumbledore rocker, all right," said ron.
"listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast TOMorrow.
the points are all in and SLYTHERINS won, of course -- you missed the last quidditch match, we were steamrollered by RAVENCLAW without you -- but the food'll be good."
at that MOMent, MADAM_POMFTEY bustled over.
"you've had nearly fifteen minutes, now out" MADAM_POMFTEY said firmly.
after a good night's sLEE_JORDANp, HARRY_POTTER felt nearly back to normal.
i want to go to the end-of-year feast ," HARRY_POTTER told MADAM_POMFTEY as MADAM_POMFTEY straightened HARRY_POTTER many candy boxes.
i can, can't i?"
". "
dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," MADAM_POMFTEY said stiffily, as though in MADAM_POMFTEY opinion professor dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be.
"and you have another visitor."
"oh, good," said HARRY_POTTER.
"who is it?"
hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke.
as usual when he was indoors, "
    hagrid looked too big to be allowed.
he sat down next to HARRY_POTTER, took one look at he, and burst into tears.
"it's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!"
he sobbed, he face in he hands.
i told the evil git how ter get past FLUFFY!
i told he!
it was the only thing he didn't know, an' i told he!
hecould've died!
all for a dragon egg!
i'll never drink again!
i should be chucked out an' made ter live as a muggle!"
"hagrid!"
said HARRY_POTTER, shocked to see "
    hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into HARRY_POTTER beard.
". "
hagrid, HARRY_POTTER'd have found out somehow, this is lord VOLDEMORT we're talking about, HARRY_POTTER'd have found out even if you hadn't told HARRY_POTTER."
"YEH could've died!"
sobbed "
    hagrid.
"an' DON' say the name!"
"VOLDEMORT!"
HARRY_POTTER CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed, and "
    hagrid was so shocked, HARRY_POTTER stopped crying.
"i've met HARRY_POTTER and i'm calling HARRY_POTTER by HARRY_POTTER name.
please cheer up, "
    hagrid, we saved black stone, it's gone, HARRY_POTTER can't use it.
have a chocolate frog, i've got loads...."
    hagrid wiped HARRY_POTTER nose on the back of HARRY_POTTER hand and said, "that reminds me.
i've got YEH a present."
"it's not a stoat sandwich, is it?"
said HARRY_POTTER anxiously, and at "
    hagrid "
    hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
"nah.
dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix ter.
'course, dumbledore shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got YEH this..."
    it seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.
HARRY_POTTER opened it curiously.
it was full of wizard photographs.
smiling and waving at HARRY_POTTER from every page were HARRY_POTTER MOTHER and father.
"sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew YEH didn' have any... d'YEH like it?HARRY_POTTER's  couldn't speak, but "
    hagrid understood.
HARRY_POTTER made HARRY_POTTER way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.
HARRY_POTTER had been held up by MADAM_POMFTEY fussing about, insisting on giving HARRY_POTTER one last checkup, so the great hall was already full.
the great hall was decked out in the SLYTHERINS colors of green and silver to celebrate SLYTHERINS's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row.
a huge banner showing the SLYTHERINS serpent covered the wall behind the high table.
when HARRY_POTTER walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody starTED talking loudly at once.
HARRY_POTTER slipped into a seat between ron and HERMLONE at the GRYFFINDOR table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at HARRY_POTTER.
fortunately, dumbledore arrived MOMents later.
the babble died away.
"another year gone!"
dumbledore said cheerfully.
"and i must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink we teeth into we delicious feast.
what a year it has been!
hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than your heads were... you have the whole summer ahead to get your heads nice and empty before next year starts....
    "now, as i understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: in fourth place, GRYFFINDOR, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, HUFFLEPUFFS, with three hundred and fifty-two; RAVENCLAW has four hundred and twenty-six and SLYTHERINS, four hundred and seventy- two."
a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the SLYTHERINS table.
HARRY_POTTER could see DRACO_MALFOY banging HARRY_POTTER goblet on the SLYTHERINS table.
it was a sickening sight.
"yes, yes, well DONe, SLYTHERINS," said dumbledore.
"however, recent events must be taken into account."
the room went very still.
the SLYTHERINS' smiles faded a little.
"ahem," said dumbledore.
"i have a few last-minute points to dish out.
let me see.
yes...
    "first -- to mr. RONALD_WEASLEY..."
    ron went purple in the face; "
    ron looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
"...for the best-played game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years, i award GRYFFINDOR house fifty points."
GRYFFINDOR cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
PERCY_WEASLEY could be heard telling the other prefects, "my brother, you know!
my youngest brother!
got past MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's giant chess set!"
at last there was silence again.
"second -- to miss HERMIONE_GRANGER... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, i award GRYFFINDOR house fifty points."
HERMLONE buried "
    HERMLONE face in her arms; HARRY_POTTER strongly suspecTED "
    HERMLONE had burst into tears.
GRYFFINDORs up and down the table were beside GRYFFINDORs up and down the table -- GRYFFINDORs up and down the table were a hundred points up.
"third -- to mr. HARRY_POTTER..." said dumbledore.
the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, i award GRYFFINDOR house sixty points."
the din was deafening.
those who could add up while yelling those who could add up hoarse knew that GRYFFINDOR now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as SLYTHERINS.
those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that GRYFFINDOR now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as SLYTHERINS had tied for the house cup -- if only dumbledore had GIVEN_HARRY just one more point.
dumbledore raised dumbledore hand.
the room gradually fell silent.
"there are all kinds of courage," said dumbledore, smiling.
"it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
i therefore award ten points to mr. MR._LONGBOTTOM."
someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupTED from the GRYFFINDOR table.
HARRY_POTTER, ron, and "
    HERMLONE stood up to yell and cheer as MR._LONGBOTTOM, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging MR._LONGBOTTOM.
MR._LONGBOTTOM had never won so much as a point for GRYFFINDOR before.
HARRY_POTTER, still cheering, nudged ron in the ribs and poinTED at MALFOY, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if ron'd just had the body-bind curse put on ron.
"which means, dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even RAVENCLAW and HUFFLEPUFFS were celebrating the downfall of SLYTHERINS, "we need a little change of decoration."
he clapped he hands.
in an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge SLYTHERINS serpent vanished and a towering GRYFFINDOR lion took the huge SLYTHERINS serpent  place.
SNAPEwas shaking professor MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
SNAPE caught HARRY_POTTER's eye and HARRY_POTTER knew at once that SNAPE's feelings toward SNAPE's  hadn't changed one jot.
this didn't worry HARRY_POTTER.
this seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts.
it was the best evening of HARRY_POTTER's life, better than winning at quidditch, or christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.
HARRY_POTTER had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did.
to they great surprise, both HARRY_POTTER and ronpassed with good marks; "
    HERMLONE, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
even MR._LONGBOTTOM scraped through, even MR._LONGBOTTOM good herbology mark making up for even MR._LONGBOTTOM abysmal potions one.
both he and ron  had hoped that GOYLE, who was almost as stupid as even MR._LONGBOTTOM was mean, might be thrown out, but even MR._LONGBOTTOM had passed, too.
it was a shame, but as ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.
and suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, MR._LONGBOTTOM's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning all students not to use magic over the holidays ("i always hope all students'll forget to give us these," said FRED_WEASLEY sadly); "
    hagrid was there to take all students down to the fLEE_JORDANt of boats that sailed across the lake; all students were boarding the hogwarts express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans as all students sped past muggle towns; pulling off all students wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at king's cross station.
it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform.
a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them all go through the gate in twos and threes so them all didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles.
"you must come and stay this summer," said ron, "both of ron -- i'll send you an owl."
"thanks," said HARRY_POTTER, "i'll need something to look forward to."
people jostled people as people moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world.
some of people called:
    "bye, HARRY_POTTER!"
"see you, POTTER!"
"still famous," said ron, grinning at ron.
"not where i'm going, i promise you," said HARRY_POTTER.
both he and ron  passed through the gateway together.
"there he is, MOM, there he is, look!"
it was GINNY_WEASLEY, ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at ron.
"HARRY_POTTER!"
she squealed.
"look, MOM!
i can see
    "be quiet, GINNY_WEASLEY, and it's rude to point."
MRS._WEASLEY smiled down at them.
"busy year?"
she said.
"very," said HARRY_POTTER.
"thanks for the fudge and the sweater, mrs.
weasley."
"oh, it was nothing, dear."
"ready, are you?"
it was UNCLE_VERNON, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of HARRY_POTTER, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
behind him stood AUNT_PETUNIA and dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of HARRY_POTTER.
"you must be HARRY_POTTER's family!"
said "
    MRS._WEASLEY.
"in a manner of speaking," said UNCLE_VERNON.
"hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day."
him walked away.
HARRY_POTTER hung back for a last word with ron and HERMLONE.
"see you over the summer, then."
"hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said "
    HERMLONE, looking uncertainly after UNCLE_VERNON, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.
"oh, i will," said HARRY_POTTER, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over HARRY_POTTER face.
"they DON't know they're not allowed to use magic at home.
i'm going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer...."
    the end
