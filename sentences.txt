     HARRY_POTTER and the sorcerer's stone.
chapter one.
the boy who lived.
mr. and  MRS._DURSLEY, of number four, privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
they were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
mr.  DUrsley was the director of a firm called grunnings, which made drills.
he was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.
 MRS._DURSLEY was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.
the  DURSLEYS had a small son called  DUdley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
the  DURSLEYS had everything they wan TED, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
they didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the  POTTERs.
mrs.  POTTER was  MRS._DURSLEY's sister, but they hadn't met for several  YEWars; in fact,  MRS._DURSLEY pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as un DUrsleyish as it was possible to be.
the  DURSLEYS shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the  POTTERs arrived in the street.
the  DURSLEYS knew that the  POTTERs had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.
this boy was another good reason for keeping the  POTTERs away; they didn't want  DUdley mixing with a child like that.
when mr. and  MRS._DURSLEY woke up on the  DUll, gray tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.
mr.  DUrsley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and  MRS._DURSLEY gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming  DUdley into his high chair.
none of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
at half past eight, mr.  DUrsley picked up his briefcase, pecked  MRS._DURSLEY on the cheek, and tried to kiss  DUdley good-b YEW but missed, because  DUdley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
"little tyke," chortled mr.  DUrsley as he left the house.
he got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map.
for a second, mr.  DUrsley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again.
there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive, but there wasn't a map in sight.
what could he have been thinking of?
it must have been a trick of the light.
mr.  DUrsley blinked and stared at the cat.
it stared back.
as mr.  DUrsley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.
it was now reading the sign that said privet drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs.
mr.  DUrsley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.
as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
but on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.
as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.
people in cl OAKs.
mr.  DUrsley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!
he supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his e YEWs fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.
they were whispering exci TEDly together.
mr.  DUrsley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cl OAK!
the nerve of him!
but then it struck mr.  DUrsley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...  YEWs, that would be it.
the traffic moved on and a few minutes later, mr.  DUrsley arrived in the grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
mr.  DUrsley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.
if he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.
he didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they poin TED and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.
most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime.
mr.  DUrsley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.
he  YEWlled at five different people.
he made several important telephone calls and shou TED a bit more.
he was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
he'd forgotten all about the people in cl OAKs until he passed a group of them next to the baker's.
he e YEWd them angrily as he passed.
he didn't know why, but they made him uneasy.
this bunch were whispering exci TEDly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.
it was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.
"the  POTTERs, that's right, that's what i heard  YEWs, their son, harry"
    mr.  DUrsley stopped dead.
fear flooded him.
he looked back at the whisperers as if he wan TED to say something to them, but thought better of it.
he dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind.
he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid.
 POTTER wasn't such an unusual name.
he was sure there were lots of people called  POTTER who had a son called harry.
come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called harry.
he'd never even seen the boy.
it might have been  HARVEY.
or  HAROLD.
there was no point in worrying  MRS._DURSLEY; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.
he didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cl OAKs...
he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
"sorry," he grun TED, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
it was a few seconds before mr.  DUrsley realized that the man was wearing a violet cl OAK.
he didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.
on the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, " DON't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!
rejoice, for  YOU-KNOW-who has gone at last!
even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!"
and the old man hugged mr.  DUrsley around the middle and walked off.
mr.  DUrsley stood roo TED to the spot.
he had been hugged by a complete stranger.
he also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was.
he was rattled.
he hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.
as he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spot TED that morning.
it was now sitting on his garden wall.
he was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its e YEWs.
"shoo!"
said mr.  DUrsley loudly.
the cat didn't move.
it just gave him a stern look.
was this normal cat behavior?
mr.  DUrsley wondered.
trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house.
he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.
 MRS._DURSLEY had had a nice, normal day.
she told him over dinner all about mrs.  NEXT_DOOR's problems with her daughter and how  DUdley had learned a new word ("won't!").
mr.  DUrsley tried to act normally.
when  DUdley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
    "and finally, bird-watchers everywhere have repor TED that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today.
although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.
experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their s LEE_JORDANping pattern."
the newscaster allowed himself a grin.
"most mysterious.
and now, over to  JIM_MCGUFFIN with the weather.
going to be any more showers of owls tonight,  JIM_MCGUFFIN?"
"well,  TED," said the weatherman, "i  DON't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.
viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, and  DUndee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised  YEWsterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars!
perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early -- it's not until next week, folks!
but i can promise a wet night tonight."
mr.  DUrsley sat frozen in his armchair.
shooting stars all over britain?
owls flying by daylight?
mysterious people in cl OAKs all over the place?
and a whisper, a whisper about the  POTTERs...
     MRS._DURSLEY came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.
it was no good.
he'd have to say something to her.
he cleared his throat nervously.
"er --  PETUNIA, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?"
as he had expec TED,  MRS._DURSLEY looked shocked and angry.
after all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
"no," she said sharply.
"why?"
"funny stuff on the news," mr.  DUrsley mumbled.
"owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
    "so?"
snapped  MRS._DURSLEY.
"well, i just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd."
 MRS._DURSLEY sipped her tea through pursed lips.
mr.  DUrsley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name " POTTER."
he decided he didn't dare.
instead he said, as casually as he could, "their son -- he'd be about  DUdley's age now, wouldn't he?"
"i suppose so," said  MRS._DURSLEY stiffly.
"what's his name again?
 HOWARD, isn't it?"
"harry.
nasty, common name, if you ask me."
"oh,  YEWs," said mr.  DUrsley, his heart sinking horribly.
" YEWs, i quite agree."
he didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
while  MRS._DURSLEY was in the bathroom, mr.  DUrsley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.
the cat was still there.
it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something.
was he imagining things?
could all this have anything to do with the  POTTERs?
if it did... if it got out that they were rela TED to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.
the  DURSLEYS got into bed.
 MRS._DURSLEY fell as LEE_JORDANp quickly but mr.  DUrsley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.
his last, comforting thought before he fell as LEE_JORDANp was that even if the  POTTERs were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and  MRS._DURSLEY.
the  POTTERs knew very well what he and  PETUNIA thought about them and their kind....
he couldn't see how he and  PETUNIA could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them....
    how very wrong he was.
mr.  DUrsley might have been drifting into an uneasy s LEE_JORDANp, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of s LEE_JORDANpiness.
it was sitting as still as a statue, its e YEWs fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive.
it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.
in fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.
a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.
the cat's tail twitched and its e YEWs narrowed.
nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive.
he was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
he was wearing long robes, a purple cl OAK that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
his blue e YEWs were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.
this man's name was  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
 ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.
he was busy rummaging in his cl OAK, looking for something.
but he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.
for some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.
he chuckled and muttered, "i should have known."
he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.
he flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.
the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.
he clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness.
twelve times he clicked the put-outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the e YEWs of the cat watching him.
if anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-e YEWd  MRS._DURSLEY, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.
 DUmbledore slipped the put-outer back inside his cl OAK and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.
he didn't look at it, but after a  MOMent he spoke to it.
"fancy seeing you here, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL."
he turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.
instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its e YEWs.
she, too, was wearing a cl OAK, an emerald one.
her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.
she looked distinctly ruffled.
"how did you know it was me?"
she asked.
"my dear professor, i 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
"you'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"all day?
when you could have been celebrating?
i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here."
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL sniffed angrily.
"oh  YEWs, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
"you'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the muggles have noticed something's going on.
it was on their news."
she jerked her head back at the  DURSLEYS' dark living-room window.
"i heard it.
flocks of owls... shooting stars.... well, they're not completely stupid.
they were bound to notice something.
shooting stars down in kent -- i'll bet that was dedalus  DIGGLE.
he never had much sense."
"you can't blame them," said  DUmbledore gently.
"we've had precious little to celebrate for eleven  YEWars."
"i know that," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL irritably.
"but that's no reason to lose our heads.
people are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, swapping rumors."
she threw a sharp, sideways glance at  DUmbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on.
"a fine thing it would be if, on the very day you KNOW-WHO seems to have disappeared at last, the muggles found out about us all.
i suppose he really has gone,  DUmbledore?"
"it certainly seems so," said  DUmbledore.
"we have much to be thankful for.
would you care for a lemon drop?"
"a what?"
"a lemon drop.
they're a kind of muggle sweet i'm rather fond of"
    "no, thank you," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL coldly, as though she didn't think this was the  MOMent for lemon drops.
"as i say, even if  YOU-KNOW-who has gone -"
    "my dear professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name?
all this 'you-  KNOW-WHO' nonsense -- for eleven  YEWars i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:  VOLDEMORT."
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL flinched, but  DUmbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.
"it all gets so confusing if we keep saying ' YOU-KNOW-who.'
i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying  VOLDEMORT's name.
"i know you haven 't, said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, sounding half exaspera TED, half admiring.
"but you're different.
everyone knows you're the only one  YOU-KNOW- oh, all right,  VOLDEMORT, was frightened of."
"you flatter me," said  DUmbledore calmly.
" VOLDEMORT had powers i will never have."
"only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."
"it's lucky it's dark.
i haven't blushed so much since  MADAM_POMFTEY told me she liked my new earmuffs."
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL shot a sharp look at  DUmbledore and said, "the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.
you know what everyone's saying?
about why he's disappeared?
about what finally stopped him?"
it seemed that professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed  DUmbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.
it was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until  DUmbledore told her it was true.
 DUmbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
"what they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night  VOLDEMORT turned up in  GODRIC's hollow.
he went to find the  POTTERs.
the rumor is that  LILY and  JAMES_POTTER  POTTER are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "
 DUmbledore bowed his head.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL gasped.
" LILY and  JAMES_POTTER...
i can't believe it...
i didn't want to believe it... oh,  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE..."
     DUmbledore reached out and pat TED her on the shoulder.
"i know...
i know..." he said heavily.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's voice trembled as she went on.
"that's not all.
they're saying he tried to kill the  POTTER's son, harry.
but -- he couldn't.
he couldn't kill that little boy.
no one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill  HARRY_POTTER,  VOLDEMORT's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.
 DUmbledore nodded glumly.
"it's -- it's true?"
faltered professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"after all he's  DONe... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?
it's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did harry survive?"
"we can only guess," said  DUmbledore.
"we may never know."
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her e YEWs beneath her spectacles.
 DUmbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it.
it was a very odd watch.
it had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.
it must have made sense to  DUmbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "hagrid's late.
i suppose it was he who told you i'd be here, by the way?"
" YEWs," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"and i  DON't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?"
"i've come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle.
they're the only family he has left now."
"you  DON't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?"
cried professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.
" DUmbledore -- you can't.
i've been watching them all day.
you couldn't find two people who are less like us.
and they've got this son -- i saw him kicking his  MOTHER all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
 HARRY_POTTER come and live here!"
"it's the best place for him," said  DUmbledore firmly.
"his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older.
i've written them a letter."
"a letter?"
repea TED professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL faintly, sitting back down on the wall.
"really,  DUmbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?
these people will never understand him!
he'll be famous -- a legend -- i wouldn't be surprised if today was known as  HARRY_POTTER day in the future -- there will be books written about harry -- every child in our world will know his name!"
"exactly," said  DUmbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.
"it would be enough to turn any boy's head.
famous before he can walk and talk!
famous for something he won't even remember!
cara you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?"
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, " YEWs --  YEWs, you're right, of course.
but how is the boy getting here,  DUmbledore?"
she e YEWd his cl OAK suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it.
"hagrid's bringing him."
"you think it -- wise -- to trust hagrid with something as important as this?"
i would trust hagrid with my life," said  DUmbledore.
"i'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless.
he does tend to -- what was that?"
a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.
it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
if the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.
he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.
he looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.
in his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.
"hagrid," said  DUmbledore, sounding relieved.
"at last.
and where did you get that motorcycle?"
"borrowed it, professor  DUmbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.
"young sirius black lent it to me.
i've got him, sir."
"no problems, were there?"
"no, sir -- house was almost destro YEWd, but i got him out all right before the muggles star TED swarmin' around.
he fell as LEE_JORDANp as we was flyin' over bristol."
 DUmbledore and professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL bent forward over the bundle of blankets.
inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast as LEE_JORDANp.
under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
"is that where -?"
whispered professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
" YEWs," said  DUmbledore.
"he'll have that scar forever."
"couldn't you do something about it,  DUmbledore?"
"even if i could, i wouldn't.
scars can come in handy.
i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the lon DON underground.
well -- give him here, hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."
 DUmbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the  DURSLEYS' house.
"could i -- could i say good-b YEW to him, sir?"
asked hagrid.
he bent his great, shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.
then, suddenly, hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.
"shhh!"
hissed professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, "you'll wake the muggles!"
"s-s-sorry," sobbed hagrid, taking out a large, spot TED handkerchief and burying his face in it.
"but i c-c-can't stand it --  LILY an'  JAMES_POTTER dead -- an' poor little harry off ter live with muggles -"
    " YEWs,  YEWs, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, hagrid, or we'll be found," professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL whispered, patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as  DUmbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.
he laid harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cl OAK, tucked it inside harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.
for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; hagrid's shoulders shook, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from  DUmbledore's e YEWs seemed to have gone out.
"well," said  DUmbledore finally, "that's that.
we've no business staying here.
we may as well go and join the celebrations."
" YEWah," said hagrid in a very muffled voice, "i'll be takin' sirius his bike back.
g'night, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL -- professor  DUmbledore, sir."
wiping his streaming e YEWs on his jacket s LEE_JORDANve, hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
"i shall see you soon, i expect, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL," said  DUmbledore, nodding to her.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL blew her nose in reply.
 DUmbledore turned and walked back down the street.
on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put-outer.
he clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
"good luck, harry," he murmured.
he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cl OAK, he was gone.
a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
 HARRY_POTTER rolled over inside his blankets without waking up.
one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by  MRS._DURSLEY's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin  DUdley...
he couldn't know that at this very  MOMent, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "to  HARRY_POTTER -- the boy who lived!"
chapter two.
the vanishing glass.
nearly ten  YEWars had passed since the  DURSLEYS had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all.
the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the  DURSLEYS' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr.  DUrsley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.
only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
ten  YEWars ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but  DUdley  DUrsley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his  MOTHER.
the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
 YEWt  HARRY_POTTER was still there, as LEE_JORDANp at the  MOMent, but not for long.
his  AUNT_PETUNIA was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.
"up!
get up!
now!"
harry woke with a start.
his aunt rapped on the door again.
"up!"
she screeched.
harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove.
he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having.
it had been a good one.
there had been a flying motorcycle in it.
he had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before.
his aunt was back outside the door.
"are you up  YEWt?"
she demanded.
"nearly," said harry.
"well, get a move on, i want you to look after the bacon.
and  DON't you dare let it burn, i want everything perfect on  DUDDY's birthday."
harry groaned.
"what did you say?"
his aunt snapped through the door.
"nothing, nothing..."
     DUdley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten?
harry got slowly out of bed and star TED looking for socks.
he found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.
harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.
when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen.
the table was almost hidden beneath all  DUdley's birthday presents.
it looked as though  DUdley had gotten the new computer he wan TED, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.
exactly why  DUdley wan TED a racing bike was a mystery to harry, as  DUdley was very fat and ha TED exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody.
 DUdley's favorite punching bag was harry, but he couldn't often catch him.
harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.
perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but harry had always been small and skinny for his age.
he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of  DUdley's, and  DUdley was about four times bigger than he was.
harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green e YEWs.
he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times  DUdley had punched him on the nose.
the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning.
he had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his  AUNT_PETUNIA was how he had gotten it.
"in the car crash when your parents died," she had said.
"and  DON't ask questions."
 DON't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the  DURSLEYS.
 UNCLE_VERNON entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon.
"comb your hair!"
he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
about once a week,  UNCLE_VERNON looked over the top of his newspaper and shou TED that harry needed a haircut.
harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put
    together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.
harry was frying eggs by the time  DUdley arrived in the kitchen with his  MOTHER.
 DUdley looked a lot like  UNCLE_VERNON.
he had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue e YEWs, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.
 AUNT_PETUNIA often said that  DUdley looked like a baby angel -- harry often said that  DUdley looked like a pig in a wig.
harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room.
 DUdley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.
his face fell.
"thirty-six," he said, looking up at his  MOTHER and father.
"that's two less than last  YEWar."
"darling, you haven't coun TED  AUNTIE_MARGE's present, see, it's here under this big one from  MOMmy and daddy."
"all right, thirty-seven then," said  DUdley, going red in the face.
harry, who could see a huge  DUdley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case  DUdley turned the table over.
 AUNT_PETUNIA obviously scen TED danger, too, because she said quickly, "and we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today.
how's that, popkin?
two more presents.
is that all right''
     DUdley thought for a  MOMent.
it looked like hard work.
finally he said slowly, "so i'll have thirty ... thirty..."
    "thirty-nine, sweetums," said  AUNT_PETUNIA.
"oh."
 DUdley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel.
"all right then."
 UNCLE_VERNON chuckled.
"little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father.
'atta boy,  DUdley!"
he ruffled  DUdley's hair.
at that  MOMent the telephone rang and  AUNT_PETUNIA went to answer it while harry and  UNCLE_VERNON watched  DUdley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a vcr.
he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when  AUNT_PETUNIA came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
"bad news,  MRS._DURSLEY," she said.
"mrs.  FIGG's broken her leg.
she can't take him."
she jerked her head in harry's direction.
 DUdley's mouth fell open in horror, but harry's heart gave a leap.
every  YEWar on  DUdley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.
every  YEWar, harry was left behind with mrs.  FIGG, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.
harry ha TED it there.
the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs.  FIGG made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.
"now what?"
said  AUNT_PETUNIA, looking furiously at harry as though he'd planned this.
harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs.  FIGG had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole  YEWar before he had to look at  TIBBLES, snowy, mr.  PAWS, and  TUFTY again.
"we could phone  MARGE,"  UNCLE_VERNON sugges TED.
" DON't be silly,  MRS._DURSLEY, she hates the boy."
the  DURSLEYS often spoke about harry like this, as though he wasn't there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug.
"what about what's-her-name, your friend --  YVONNE?"
"on vacation in majorca," snapped  AUNT_PETUNIA.
"you could just leave me here," harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wan TED on television for a change and maybe even have a go on  DUdley's computer).
 AUNT_PETUNIA looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.
"and come back and find the house in ruins?"
she snarled.
"i won't blow up the house," said harry, but they weren't listening.
"i suppose we could take him to the zoo," said  AUNT_PETUNIA slowly, "... and leave him in the car...."
    "that car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."
     DUdley began to cry loudly.
in fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had been  YEWars since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his  MOTHER would give him anything he wan TED.
"dinky  DUDDY DUms,  DON't cry,  MUMMY won't let him spoil your special day!"
she cried, flinging her arms around him.
"i...  DON't... want... him... t-t-to come!"
 DUdley  YEWlled between huge, pretend sobs.
"he always sp- spoils everything!"
he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his  MOTHER's arms.
just then, the door CHASER_KATIE_BELL rang -- "oh, good lord, they're here!"
said  AUNT_PETUNIA frantically -- and a  MOMent later,  DUdley's best friend,  PIERS_POLKISS, walked in with his  MOTHER.
 PIERS_POLKISS was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat.
he was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while  DUdley hit them.
 DUdley stopped pretending to cry at once.
half an hour later, harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the  DURSLEYS' car with  PIERS_POLKISS and  DUdley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.
his aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left,  UNCLE_VERNON had taken harry aside.
"i'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to harry's, "i'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until christmas."
"i'm not going to do anything," said harry, "honestly..
but  UNCLE_VERNON didn't believe him.
no one ever did.
the problem was, strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the  DURSLEYS he didn't make them happen.
once,  AUNT_PETUNIA, tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar."
 DUdley had laughed himself silly at harry, who spent a s LEE_JORDANpless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before  AUNT_PETUNIA had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
another time,  AUNT_PETUNIA had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of  DUdley's ( BROWN with orange puff balls) -- the harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fit TED a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit harry.
 AUNT_PETUNIA had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, harry wasn't punished.
on the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.
 DUdley's gang had been  CHASINg him as usual when, as much to harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney.
the  DURSLEYS had received a very angry letter from harry's headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings.
but all he'd tried to do (as he shou TED at  UNCLE_VERNON through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.
harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump.
but today, nothing was going to go wrong.
it was even worth being with  DUdley and  PIERS_POLKISS to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or mrs.  FIGG's cabbage-smelling living room.
while he drove,  UNCLE_VERNON complained to  AUNT_PETUNIA.
he liked to complain about things: people at work, harry, the council, harry, the bank, and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.
this morning, it was motorcycles.
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.
i had a dream about a motorcycle," said harry, remembering suddenly.
"it was flying."
 UNCLE_VERNON nearly crashed into the car in front.
he turned right around in his seat and  YEWlled at harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "motorcycles  DON't fly!"
 DUdley and  PIERS_POLKISS sniggered.
i know they  DON't," said harry.
"it was only a dream."
but he wished he hadn't said anything.
if there was one thing the  DURSLEYS ha TED even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.
it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.
the  DURSLEYS bought  DUdley and  PIERS_POLKISS large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wan TED before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.
it wasn't bad, either, harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like  DUdley, except that it wasn't blond.
harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time.
he was careful to walk a little way apart from the  DURSLEYS so that  DUdley and  PIERS_POLKISS, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him.
they ate in the zoo restaurant, and when  DUdley had a tantrum because his k NICKerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top,  UNCLE_VERNON bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first.
harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.
after lunch they went to the reptile house.
it was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.
behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of  WOOD and stone.
 DUdley and  PIERS_POLKISS wan TED to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.
 DUdley quickly found the largest snake in the place.
it could have wrapped its body twice around  UNCLE_VERNON's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the  MOMent it didn't look in the mood.
in fact, it was fast as LEE_JORDANp.
 DUdley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening  BROWN coils.
"make it move," he whined at his father.
 UNCLE_VERNON tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.
"do it again,"  DUdley ordered.
 UNCLE_VERNON rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
"this is boring,"  DUdley moaned.
he shuffled away.
harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.
he wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.
it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was  AUNT_PETUNIA hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
the snake suddenly opened its beady e YEWs.
slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its e YEWs were on a level with harry's.
it winked.
harry stared.
then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.
they weren't.
he looked back at the snake and winked, too.
the snake jerked its head toward  UNCLE_VERNON and  DUdley, then raised its e YEWs to the ceiling.
it gave harry a look that said quite plainly:
    "i get that all the time.
"i know," harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him.
"it must be really annoying."
the snake nodded vigorously.
"where do you come from, anyway?"
harry asked.
the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.
harry peered at it.
 BOA_CONSTRICTOR, brazil.
"was it nice there?"
the  BOA_CONSTRICTOR jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on: this specimen was bred in the zoo.
"oh, i see -- so you've never been to brazil?"
as the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump.
" DUdley!
mr.  DUrsley!
come and look at this snake!
you won't believe what it's doing!"
 DUdley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
"out of the way, you," he said, punching harry in the ribs.
caught by surprise, harry fell hard on the concrete floor.
what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second,  PIERS_POLKISS and  DUdley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.
harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the  BOA_CONSTRICTOR's tank had vanished.
the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.
people throughout the reptile house screamed and star TED running for the exits.
as the snake slid swiftly past him, harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "brazil, here i come.... thanksss, amigo."
the keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
"but the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
the zoo director himself made  AUNT_PETUNIA a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again.
 PIERS_POLKISS and  DUdley could only gibber.
as far as harry had seen, the snake hadn't  DONe anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in  UNCLE_VERNON's car,  DUdley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while  PIERS_POLKISS was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.
but worst of all, for harry at least, was  PIERS_POLKISS calming down enough to say, "harry was talking to it, weren't you, harry?"
 UNCLE_VERNON wai TED until  PIERS_POLKISS was safely out of the house before starting on harry.
he was so angry he could hardly speak.
he managed to say, "go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and  AUNT_PETUNIA had to run and get him a large brandy.
harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.
he didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the  DURSLEYS were as LEE_JORDANp  YEWt.
until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.
he'd lived with the  DURSLEYS almost ten  YEWars, ten miserable  YEWars, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.
he couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died.
sometimes, when he strained his memory  DUring long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead.
this, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from.
he couldn't remember his parents at all.
his aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions.
there were no photographs of them in the house.
when he had been younger, harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the  DURSLEYS were his only family.
 YEWt sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.
very strange strangers they were, too.
a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with  AUNT_PETUNIA and  DUdley.
after asking harry furiously if he knew the man,  AUNT_PETUNIA had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything.
a wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.
a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.
the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look.
at school, harry had no one.
everybody knew that  DUdley's gang ha TED that odd  HARRY_POTTER in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with  DUdley's gang.
chapter three.
the letters from no one.
the escape of the brazilian  BOA_CONSTRICTOR earned harry his longest-ever punishment.
    by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had star TED and  DUdley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old mrs.  FIGG as she crossed privet drive on her crutches.
harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping  DUdley's gang, who visi TED the house every single day.
 PIERS_POLKISS,  DENNIS,  MALCOLM, and gor DON were all big and stupid, but as  DUdley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader.
the rest of them were all quite happy to join in  DUdley's favorite sport:  HARRY_HUNTING.
this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope.
when september came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with  DUdley.
 DUdley had been accep TED at  UNCLE_VERNON's old private school,  SMELTINGS.
 PIERS_POLKISS was going there too.
harry, on the other hand, was going to stonewall high, the local public school.
 DUdley thought this was very funny.
"they stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall," he told harry.
"want to come upstairs and practice?"
"no, thanks," said harry.
"the poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick."
then he ran, before  DUdley could work out what he'd said.
one day in july,  AUNT_PETUNIA took  DUdley to lon DON to buy his  SMELTINGS uniform, leaving harry at mrs.  FIGG's.
mrs.  FIGG wasn 't as bad as usual.
it turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before.
she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tas TED as though she'd had it for several  YEWars.
that evening,  DUdley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform.
 SMELTINGS' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange k NICKerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters.
they also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking.
this was supposed to be good training for later life.
as he looked at  DUdley in his new k NICKerbockers,  UNCLE_VERNON said gruffly that it was the proudest  MOMent of his life.
 AUNT_PETUNIA burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her  ICKLE_DUDLEYKINS, he looked so handsome and grown-up.
harry didn't trust himself to speak.
he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.
there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast.
it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.
he went to have a look.
the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.
"what's this?"
he asked  AUNT_PETUNIA.
her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.
"your new school uniform," she said.
harry looked in the bowl again.
"oh," he said, "i didn't realize it had to be so wet."
"dota be stupid," snapped  AUNT_PETUNIA.
"i'm d YEWing some of  DUdley's old things gray for you.
it'll look just like everyone else's when i've finished."
harry seriously doub TED this, but thought it best not to argue.
he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.
 DUdley and  UNCLE_VERNON came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry's new uniform.
 UNCLE_VERNON opened his newspaper as usual and  DUdley banged his smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.
they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.
"get the mail,  DUdley," said  UNCLE_VERNON from behind his paper.
"make harry get it."
"get the mail, harry."
"make  DUdley get it."
"poke him with your smelting stick,  DUdley."
harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail.
three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from  UNCLE_VERNON's sister  MARGE, who was vacationing on the isle of  WIGHT, a  BROWN envelope that looked like a  BILL, and -- a letter for harry.
harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band.
no one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him.
who would?
he had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back.
 YEWt here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
    mr. h.  POTTER
    the cupboard under the stairs
    4 privet drive
    little whinging
    surrey
    the envelope was thick and heavy, made of  YEWllowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink.
there was no stamp.
turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter h.
    "hurry up, boy!"
shou TED  UNCLE_VERNON from the kitchen.
"what are you doing, checking for letter bombs?"
he chuckled at his own joke.
harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.
he handed  UNCLE_VERNON the  BILL and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the  YEWllow envelope.
 UNCLE_VERNON ripped open the  BILL, snor TED in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.
" MARGE's ill," he informed  AUNT_PETUNIA.
"ate a funny whelk.
--."
"dad!"
said  DUdley suddenly.
"dad, harry's got something!"
harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by  UNCLE_VERNON.
"that's mine!"
said harry, trying to snatch it back.
"who'd be writing to you?"
sneered  UNCLE_VERNON, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights.
and it didn't stop there.
within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.
"p-p- PETUNIA!"
he gasped.
 DUdley tried to grab the letter to read it, but  UNCLE_VERNON held it high out of his reach.
 AUNT_PETUNIA took it curiously and read the first line.
for a  MOMent it looked as though she might faint.
she clutched her throat and made a choking noise.
" MRS._DURSLEY!
oh my goodness --  MRS._DURSLEY!"
they stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that harry and  DUdley were still in the room.
 DUdley wasn't used to being ignored.
he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick.
"i want to read that letter," he said loudly.
want to read it," said harry furiously, "as it's mine."
"get out, both of you," cr OAKed  UNCLE_VERNON, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.
harry didn't move.
i want my letter!"
he shou TED.
"let me see it!"
demanded  DUdley.
"out!"
roared  UNCLE_VERNON, and he took both harry and  DUdley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them.
harry and  DUdley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole;  DUdley won, so harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his s TOMach to listen at the crack between door and floor.
" MRS._DURSLEY,"  AUNT_PETUNIA was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he s LEE_JORDANps?
you  DON't think they're watching the house?"
"watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered  UNCLE_VERNON wildly.
"but what should we do,  MRS._DURSLEY?
should we write back?
tell them we  DON't want --"
    harry could see  UNCLE_VERNON's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.
"no," he said finally.
"no, we'll ignore it.
if they  DON't get an answer...
 YEWs, that's best... we won't do anything....
    "but --"
    "i'm not having one in the house,  PETUNIA!
didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"
that evening when he got back from work,  UNCLE_VERNON did something he'd never  DONe before; he visi TED harry in his cupboard.
"where's my letter?"
said harry, the  MOMent  UNCLE_VERNON had squeezed through the door.
"who's writing to me?"
"no one.
it was addressed to you by mistake," said  UNCLE_VERNON shortly.
"i have burned it."
"it was not a mistake," said harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it."
"silence!"
 YEWlled  UNCLE_VERNON, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling.
he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.
"er --  YEWs, harry -- about this cupboard.
your aunt and i have been thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into  DUdley's second bedroom.
"why?"
said harry.
" DON't ask questions!"
snapped his uncle.
"take this stuff upstairs, now."
the  DURSLEYS' house had four bedrooms: one for  UNCLE_VERNON and  AUNT_PETUNIA, one for visitors (usually  UNCLE_VERNON's sister,  MARGE), one where  DUdley slept, and one where  DUdley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom.
it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room.
he sat down on the bed and stared around him.
nearly everything in here was broken.
the month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank  DUdley had once driven over the  NEXT_DOOR neighbor's dog; in the corner was  DUdley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that  DUdley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because  DUdley had sat on it.
other shelves were full of books.
they were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched.
from downstairs came the sound of  DUdley bawling at his  MOTHER, i  DON't want him in there...
i need that room... make him get out...."
    harry sighed and stretched out on the bed.
 YEWsterday he'd have given anything to be up here.
today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.
next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet.
 DUdley was in shock.
he'd screamed, whacked his father with his smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his  MOTHER, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back.
harry was thinking about this time  YEWsterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall.
 UNCLE_VERNON and  AUNT_PETUNIA kept looking at each other darkly.
when the mail arrived,  UNCLE_VERNON, who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry, made  DUdley go and get it.
they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall.
then he shou TED, "there's another one!
'mr.
h.  POTTER, the smallest bedroom, 4 privet drive --'"
    with a strangled cry,  UNCLE_VERNON leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, harry right behind him.
 UNCLE_VERNON had to wrestle  DUdley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed  UNCLE_VERNON around the neck from behind.
after a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick,  UNCLE_VERNON straightened up, gasping for breath, with harry's letter clutched in his hand.
"go to your cupboard -- i mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at harry.
" DUdley -- go -- just go."
harry walked round and round his new room.
someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first letter.
surely that meant they'd try again?
and this time he'd make sure they didn't fail.
he had a plan.
the repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning.
harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently.
he mustn't wake the  DURSLEYS.
he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first.
his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --
    harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!
lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle's face.
 UNCLE_VERNON had been lying at the foot of the front door in a s LEE_JORDANping bag, clearly making sure that harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do.
he shou TED at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.
harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into  UNCLE_VERNON's lap.
harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.
i want --" he began, but  UNCLE_VERNON was tearing the letters into pieces before his e YEWs.
 UNCLE_VERNON didnt go to work that day.
he sta YEWd at home and nailed up the mail slot.
"see," he explained to  AUNT_PETUNIA through a mouthful of nails, "if they can't deliver them they'll just give up."
"i'm not sure that'll work,  MRS._DURSLEY."
"oh, these people's minds work in strange ways,  PETUNIA, they're not like you and me," said  UNCLE_VERNON, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake  AUNT_PETUNIA had just brought him.
on friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for harry.
as they couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slot TED through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.
 UNCLE_VERNON sta YEWd at home again.
after burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out.
he hummed "tiptoe through the tulips" as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
on saturday, things began to get out of hand.
twenty-four letters to harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed  AUNT_PETUNIA through the living room window.
while  UNCLE_VERNON made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to,  AUNT_PETUNIA shredded the letters in her food processor.
"who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?"
 DUdley asked harry in amazement.
on sunday morning,  UNCLE_VERNON sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.
"no post on sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --"
    something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head.
next  MOMent, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets.
the  DURSLEYS  DUcked, but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.
"out!
out!"
 UNCLE_VERNON seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.
when  AUNT_PETUNIA and  DUdley had run out with their arms over their faces,  UNCLE_VERNON slammed the door shut.
they could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
"that does it," said  UNCLE_VERNON, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time.
i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave.
we're going away.
just pack some clothes.
no arguments!"
he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue.
ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.
 DUdley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, vcr, and computer in his sports bag.
they drove.
and they drove.
even  AUNT_PETUNIA didn't dare ask where they were going.
every now and then  UNCLE_VERNON would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.
"shake'em off... shake 'em off," he would mutter whenever he did this.
they didn't stop to eat or drink all day.
by nightfall  DUdley was howling.
he'd never had such a bad day in his life.
he was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wan TED to see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
 UNCLE_VERNON stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city.
 DUdley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets.
 DUdley snored but harry sta YEWd awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....
they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned  TOMatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.
they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.
"'scuse me, but is one of you mr. h.  POTTER?
only i got about an 'undred of these at the front desk."
she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:
    mr. h.  POTTER
    room 17
    railview hotel
    cokeworth
    harry made a grab for the letter but  UNCLE_VERNON knocked his hand out of the way.
the woman stared.
"i'll take them," said  UNCLE_VERNON, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.
wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?"
 AUNT_PETUNIA sugges TED timidly, hours later, but  UNCLE_VERNON didn't seem to hear her.
exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.
he drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again.
the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.
"daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?"
 DUdley asked  AUNT_PETUNIA  DUlly late that afternoon.
 UNCLE_VERNON had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
it star TED to rain.
great drops beat on the roof of the car.
 DUd ley sniveled.
"it's monday," he told his  MOTHER.
"the great humberto's on tonight.
i want to stay somewhere with a television. "
monday.
this reminded harry of something.
if it was monday -- and you could usually count on  DUdley to know the days the week, because of television -- then  TOMorrow, tuesday, was harry's eleventh birthday.
of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last  YEWar, the  DURSLEYS had given him a coat hanger and a pair of  UNCLE_VERNON's old socks.
still, you weren't eleven every day.
 UNCLE_VERNON was back and he was smiling.
he was also carrying a long, thin package and didn't answer  AUNT_PETUNIA when she asked what he'd bought.
"found the perfect place!"
he said.
"come on!
everyone out!"
it was very cold outside the car.
 UNCLE_VERNON was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea.
perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine.
one thing was certain, there was no television in there.
"storm forecast for tonight!"
said  UNCLE_VERNON g LEE_JORDANfully, clapping his hands together.
"and this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!"
a toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.
"i've already got us some rations," said  UNCLE_VERNON, "so all aboard!"
it was freezing in the boat.
icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.
after what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where  UNCLE_VERNON, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.
the inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the  WOODen walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.
there were only two rooms.
 UNCLE_VERNON's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.
he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
"could do with some of those letters now, eh?"
he said cheerfully.
he was in a very good mood.
obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.
harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
as night fell, the promised storm blew up around them.
spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.
 AUNT_PETUNIA found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for  DUdley on the moth-eaten sofa.
she and  UNCLE_VERNON went off to the lumpy bed  NEXT_DOOR, and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.
harry couldn't s LEE_JORDANp.
he shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his s TOMach rumbling with hunger.
 DUdley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that star TED near midnight.
the ligh TED dial of  DUdley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.
he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the  DURSLEYS would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
five minutes to go.
harry heard something creak outside.
he hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.
four minutes to go.
maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.
three minutes to go.
was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that?
and (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise?
was the rock crumbling into the sea?
one minute to go and he'd be eleven.
thirty seconds... twenty ... ten... nine -- maybe he'd wake  DUdley up, just to annoy him -- three... two... one...
    boom.
the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.
someone was outside, knocking to come in.
chapter four.
the keeper of the keys.
boom.
they knocked again.
 DUdley jerked awake.
"where's the cannon?"
he said stupidly.
there was a crash behind them and  UNCLE_VERNON came skidding into the room.
he was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
"who's there?"
he shou TED.
"i warn you -- i'm armed!"
there was a pause.
then --
    smash!
the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
a giant of a man was standing in the doorway.
his face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his e YEWs, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.
the giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling.
he bent down, picked up the door, and fit TED it easily back into its frame.
the noise of the storm outside dropped a little.
he turned to look at them all.
"couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could  YEWh?
it's not been an easy journey..."
    he strode over to the sofa where  DUdley sat frozen with fear.
"budge up,  YEWh great lump," said the stranger.
 DUdley squeaked and ran to hide behind his  MOTHER, who was crouching, terrified, behind  UNCLE_VERNON.
"an' here's harry!"
said the giant.
harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle e YEWs were crinkled in a smile.
"las' time i saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant.
" YEWh look a lot like  YEWt dad, but  YEWh've got  YEWt  MOM's e YEWs."
 UNCLE_VERNON made a funny rasping noise.
i demand that you leave at once, sit!"
he said.
"you are breaking and entering!"
"ah, shut up,  DUrsley,  YEWh great prune," said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of  UNCLE_VERNON's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.
 UNCLE_VERNON made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
"anyway -- harry," said the giant, turning his back on the  DURSLEYS, "a very happy birthday to  YEWh.
got summat for  YEWh here -- i mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right."
from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box.
harry opened it with trembling fingers.
inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing.
harry looked up at the giant.
he meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "who are you?"
the giant chuckled.
"true, i haven't intro DUced meself.
 MR._HAGRID, keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts."
he held out an enormous hand and shook harry's whole arm.
"what about that tea then, eh?"
he said, rubbing his hands together.
"i'd not say no ter summat stronger if  YEWh've got it, mind."
his e YEWs fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snor TED.
he bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there.
it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.
the giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.
soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage.
nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker,  DUdley fidge TED a little.
 UNCLE_VERNON said sharply, " DON't touch anything he gives you,  DUdley."
the giant chuckled darkly.
" YEWt great puddin' of a son  DON' need fattenin' anymore,  DUrsley,  DON' worry."
he passed the sausages to harry, who was so hungry he had never tas TED anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his e YEWs off the giant.
finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, "i'm sorry, but i still  DON't really know who you are."
the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
"call me hagrid," he said, "everyone does.
an' like i told  YEWh, i'm keeper of keys at hogwarts --  YEWh'll know all about hogwarts, o' course.
"er -- no," said harry.
hagrid looked shocked.
"sorry," harry said quickly.
"sony?"
barked hagrid, turning to stare at the  DURSLEYS, who shrank back into the shadows.
"it' s them as should be sorry!
i knew  YEWh weren't gettin'  YEWr letters but i never thought  YEWh wouldn't even know abou' hogwarts, for cryin' out loud!
did  YEWh never wonder where  YEWt parents learned it all?"
"all what?"
asked harry.
"all what?"
hagrid thundered.
"now wait jus' one second!"
he had leapt to his feet.
in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
the  DURSLEYS were cowering against the wall.
"do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the  DURSLEYS, "that this boy -- this boy!
-- knows nothin' abou' -- about anything?"
harry thought this was going a bit far.
he had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.
"i know some things," he said.
"i can, you know, do math and stuff."
but hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "about our world, i mean.
your world.
my world.
 YEWr parents' world."
"what world?"
hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
" DUrsley!"
he boomed.
 UNCLE_VERNON, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like "mimblewimble."
hagrid stared wildly at harry.
"but  YEWh must know about  YEWt  MOM and dad," he said.
"i mean, they're famous.
you're famous."
"what?
my -- my  MOM and dad weren't famous, were they?"
" YEWh  DON' know...  YEWh  DON' know..." hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing harry with a bewildered stare.
" YEWh  DON' know what  YEWh are?"
he said finally.
 UNCLE_VERNON suddenly found his voice.
"stop!"
he commanded.
"stop right there, sit!
i forbid you to tell the boy anything!"
a braver man than  MRS._DURSLEY would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him; when hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.
"you never told him?
never told him what was in the letter  DUmbledore left for him?
i was there!
i saw  DUmbledore leave it,  DUrsley!
an' you've kept it from him all these  YEWars?"
"kept what from me?"
said harry eagerly.
"stop!
i forbid you!"
 YEWlled  UNCLE_VERNON in panic.
 AUNT_PETUNIA gave a gasp of horror.
"ah, go boil  YEWt heads, both of  YEWh," said hagrid.
"harry --  YEWt a wizard."
there was silence inside the hut.
only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.
    "
-- a what?"
gasped harry.
"a wizard, o' course," said hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, i'd say, once  YEWh've been trained up a bit.
with a mum an' dad like yours, what else would  YEWh be?
an' i reckon it's abou' time  YEWh read  YEWr letter."
harry stretched out his hand at last to take the  YEWllowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to mr. h.  POTTER, the floor,  HUT-ON-THE-ROCK, the sea.
he pulled out the letter and read:
    hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
    headmaster:  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE
    (order of  MERLIN, first class,  GRANd sorc., chf.
 WARLOCK, supreme mugwump, international confed.
of wizards)
    dear mr.  POTTER,
    we are pleased to inform you that you have been accep TED at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.
please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
term begins on september 1.
we await your owl by no later than july 31.
yours sincerely,
     MINERVA_MCGONAGALL,
    deputy headmistress
    questions exploded inside harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first.
after a few minutes he stammered, "what does it mean, they await my owl?"
"gallopin' gorgons, that reminds me," said hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from  YEWt another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down:
    dear professor  DUmbledore,
     GIVEN_HARRY his letter.
taking him to buy his things  TOMorrow.
weather's horrible.
hope you're well.
hagrid
    hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm.
then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
"where was i?"
said hagrid, but at that  MOMent,  UNCLE_VERNON, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
"he's not going," he said.
hagrid grun TED.
"i'd like ter see a great muggle like you stop him," he said.
"a what?"
said harry, interes TED.
"a muggle," said hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
an' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest muggles i ever laid e YEWs on."
"we swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said  UNCLE_VERNON, "swore we'd stamp it out of him!
wizard indeed!"
"you knew?"
said harry.
"you knew i'm a -- a wizard?"
"knew!"
shrieked  AUNT_PETUNIA suddenly.
"knew!
of course we knew!
how could you not be, my drat TED sister being what she was?
oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats.
i was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!
but for my  MOTHER and father, oh no, it was  LILY this and  LILY that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!"
she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on.
it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for  YEWars.
"then she met that  POTTER at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course i knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!"
harry had gone very white.
as soon as he found his voice he said, "blown up?
you told me they died in a car crash!"
"car crash!"
roared hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the  DURSLEYS scuttled back to their corner.
"how could a car crash kill  LILY an'  JAMES_POTTER  POTTER?
it's an outrage!
a scandal!
 HARRY_POTTER not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!"
"but why?
what happened?"
harry asked urgently.
the anger faded from hagrid's face.
he looked suddenly anxious.
"i never expec TED this," he said, in a low, worried voice.
"i had no idea, when  DUmbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of  YEWh, how much  YEWh didn't know.
ah, harry, i  DON' know if i'm the right person ter tell  YEWh -- but someone 3 s gotta --  YEWh can't go off ter hogwarts not knowin'."
he threw a dirty look at the  DURSLEYS.
"well, it's best  YEWh know as much as i can tell  YEWh -- mind, i can't tell  YEWh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."
    he sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "it begins, i suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible  YEWh  DON't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"
    "who? "
"well -- i  DON' like sayin' the name if i can help it.
no one does."
"why not?"
"gulpin' gar GOYLEs, harry, people are still scared.
blimey, this is difficult.
see, there was this wizard who went... bad.
as bad as you could go.
worse.
worse than worse.
his name was..."
    hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
"could you write it down?"
harry sugges TED.
"nah -can't spell it.
all right --  VOLDEMORT. "
hagrid shuddered.
" DON' make me say it again.
anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty  YEWars ago now, star TED lookin' for followers.
got 'em, too -- some were afraid, some just wan TED a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right.
dark days, harry.
didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened.
he was takin' over.
'course, some stood up to him -- an' he killed 'em.
horribly.
one o' the only safe places left was hogwarts.
reckon  DUmbledore's the only one  YOU-KNOW-who was afraid of.
didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.
"now,  YEWr mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as i ever knew.
head boy an' girl at hogwarts in their day!
suppose the myst'ry is why  YOU-KNOW-who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter  DUmbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the dark side.
"maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wan TED 'em outta the way.
all anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on halloween ten  YEWars ago.
you was just a  YEWar old.
he came ter  YEWr house an' -- an' --"
    hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spot TED handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.
"sorry," he said.
"but it's that sad -- knew  YEWr mum an' dad, an' nicer people  YEWh couldn't find -- anyway..."
    " YOU-KNOW-who killed 'em.
an' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too.
wan TED ter make a clean job of it, i suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then.
but he couldn't do it.
never wondered how you got that mark on  YEWr forehead?
that was no ordinary cut.
that's what  YEWh get when a powerful, evil curse touches  YEWh -- took care of  YEWr mum an' dad an'  YEWr house, even -- but it didn't work on you, an' that's why  YEWr famous, harry.
no one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age -- the mckinnons, the bones, the prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived."
something very painful was going on in harry's mind.
as hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.
hagrid was watching him sadly.
"took  YEWh from the ruined house myself, on  DUmbledore's orders.
brought  YEWh ter this lot..."
    "load of old tosh," said  UNCLE_VERNON.
harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the  DURSLEYS were there.
 UNCLE_VERNON certainly seemed to have got back his courage.
he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched.
"now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "i accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what i expec TED, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"
    but at that  MOMent, hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.
pointing this at  UNCLE_VERNON like a sword, he said, "i'm warning you,  DUrsley -i'm warning you -- one more word... "
    in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,  UNCLE_VERNON's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.
"that's better," said hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
"but what happened to vol--, sorry -- i mean,  YOU-KNOW-who?"
"good question, harry.
disappeared.
vanished.
same night he tried ter kill you.
makes  YEWh even more famous.
that's the biggest myst'ry, see... he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?
"some say he died.
codswallop, in my opinion.
 DUnno if he had enough human left in him to die.
some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but i  DON' believe it.
people who was on his side came back ter ours.
some of 'em came outta kinda trances.
 DON~ reckon they could've  DONe if he was comin' back.
"most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.
too weak to carry on.
'cause somethin' about you finished him, harry.
there was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't coun TED on -- i  DUnno what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all right."
hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his e YEWs, but harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake.
a wizard?
him?
how could he possibly be?
he'd spent his life being clou TED by  DUdley, and bullied by  AUNT_PETUNIA and  UNCLE_VERNON; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard?
if he'd once defea TED the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come  DUdley had always been able to kick him around like a football?
"hagrid," he said quietly, "i think you must have made a mistake.
i  DON't think i can be a wizard."
to his surprise, hagrid chuckled.
"not a wizard, eh?
never made things happen when you was scared or angry?"
harry looked into the fire.
now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, harry, had been upset or angry... chased by  DUdley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back... and the very last time  DUdley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?
hadn't he set a  BOA_CONSTRICTOR on him?
harry looked back at hagrid, smiling, and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him.
"see?"
said hagrid.
" HARRY_POTTER, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be right famous at hogwarts."
but  UNCLE_VERNON wasn't going to give in without a fight.
"haven't i told you he's not going?"
he hissed.
"he's going to stonewall high and he'll be grateful for it.
i've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --"
    "if he wants ter go, a great muggle like you won't stop him," growled hagrid.
"stop  LILY an'  JAMES_POTTER  POTTER' s son goin' ter hogwarts!
 YEWr mad.
his name's been down ever since he was born.
he's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.
seven  YEWars there and he won't know himself.
he'll be with youngsters of his own sort, for a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE--"
    "i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!"
 YEWlled  UNCLE_VERNON.
but he had finally gone too far.
hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, "never," he thundered, "- insult-  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE-  DUmbledore- in- front- of- me!"
he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at  DUdley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second,  DUdley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bot TOM, howling in pain.
when he turned his back on them, harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers.
 UNCLE_VERNON roared.
pulling  AUNT_PETUNIA and  DUdley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them.
hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
"shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work anyway.
meant ter turn him into a pig, but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do."
he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy e YEWbrows.
"be grateful if  YEWh didn't mention that ter anyone at hogwarts," he said.
"i'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'.
i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow  YEWh an' get  YEWr letters to  YEWh an' stuff -- one o' the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job
    "why aren't you supposed to do magic?"
asked harry.
"oh, well -- i was at hogwarts meself but i -- er -- got expelled, ter tell  YEWh the truth.
in me third  YEWar.
they snapped me wand in half an' everything.
but  DUmbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper.
great man,  DUmbledore."
"why were you expelled?"
"it's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do  TOMorrow," said hagrid loudly.
"gotta get up ter town, get all  YEWr books an' that."
he took off his thick black coat and threw it to harry.
"you can kip under that," he said.
" DON' mind if it wriggles a bit, i think i still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets."
chapter five.
 DIAGON_ALLEY.
harry woke early the next morning.
although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his e YEWs shut tight.
"it was a dream, he told himself firmly.
"i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards.
when i open my e YEWs i'll be at home in my cupboard."
there was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
and there's  AUNT_PETUNIA knocking on the door, harry thought, his heart sinking.
but he still didn't open his e YEWs.
it had been such a good dream.
tap.
tap.
tap.
"all right," harry mumbled, "i'm getting up."
he sat up and hagrid's heavy coat fell off him.
the hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, hagrid himself was as LEE_JORDANp on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.
harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him.
he went straight to the window and jerked it open.
the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid, who didn't wake up.
the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid's coat.
" DON't do that."
harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
"hagrid!"
said harry loudly.
"there's an owl
    "pay him," hagrid grun TED into the sofa.
"what?"
"he wants payin' for deliverin' the paper.
look in the pockets."
hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
"give him five  KNUTS," said hagrid s LEE_JORDANpily.
" KNUTS?"
"the little bronze ones."
harry coun TED out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.
then he flew off through the open window.
hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
"best be off, harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter lon DON an' buy all  YEWr stuff for school."
harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them.
he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.
"um -- hagrid?"
"mm?"
said hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
"i haven't got any money -- and you heard  UNCLE_VERNON last night ... he won't pay for me to go and learn magic."
" DON't worry about that," said hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.
"d' YEWh think  YEWr parents didn't leave  YEWh anything?"
"but if their house was destro YEWd --"
    "they didn' keep their gold in the house, boy!
nah, first stop fer us is  GRINGOTTS.
wizards' bank.
have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' i wouldn' say no teh a bit o'  YEWr birthday cake, neither."
"wizards have banks?"
"just the one.
 GRINGOTTS.
run by goblins."
harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.
"goblins?"
" YEWah -- so  YEWh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, i'll tell  YEWh that.
never mess with goblins, harry.
 GRINGOTTS is the safest place in the world for anything  YEWh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe hogwarts.
as a matter o' fact, i gotta visit  GRINGOTTS anyway.
fer  DUmbledore.
hogwarts business."
hagrid drew himself up proudly.
"he usually gets me ter do important stuff for him.
 FETCHIN' you gettin' things from  GRINGOTTS -- knows he can trust me, see.
"got everythin'?
come on, then."
harry followed hagrid out onto the rock.
the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.
the boat  UNCLE_VERNON had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bot TOM after the storm.
"how did you get here?"
harry asked, looking around for another boat.
"flew," said hagrid.
"flew?"
" YEWah -- but we'll go back in this.
not s'pposed ter use magic now i've got  YEWh."
they settled down in the boat, harry still staring at hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.
"seems a shame ter row, though," said hagrid, giving harry another of his sideways looks.
"if i was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would  YEWh mind not mentionin' it at hogwarts?"
"of course not," said harry, eager to see more magic.
hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.
"why would you be mad to try and rob  GRINGOTTS?"
harry asked.
"spells -- enchantments," said hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke.
"they say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults.
and then  YEWh gotta find  YEWr way --  GRINGOTTS is hundreds of miles under lon DON, see.
deep under the underground.
 YEWh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if  YEWh did manage ter get  YEWr hands on summat."
harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper, the daily  PROPHET.
harry had learned from  UNCLE_VERNON that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life.
"ministry o' magic messin' things up as usual," hagrid muttered, turning the page.
"there's a ministry of magic?"
harry asked, before he could stop himself.
"'course," said hagrid.
"they wan TED  DUmbledore for minister, 0 ' course, but he'd never leave hogwarts, so old  CORNELIUS_FUDGE got the job.
bungler if ever there was one.
so he pelts  DUmbledore with owls every morning, askin' for advice."
"but what does a ministry of magic do?"
"well, their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country."
"why?"
"why?
blimey, harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems.
nah, we're best left alone."
at this  MOMent the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.
hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.
passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station.
harry couldn't blame them.
not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, "see that, harry?
things these muggles dream up, eh?"
"hagrid," said harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at  GRINGOTTS?"
"well, so they say," said hagrid.
"crikey, i'd like a dragon."
"you'd like one?"
"wan TED one ever since i was a kid -- here we go."
they had reached the station.
there was a train to lon DON in five minutes' time.
hagrid, who didn't understand "muggle money," as he called it, gave the  BILLs to harry so he could buy their tickets.
people stared more than ever on the train.
hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary- YEWllow circus tent.
"still got  YEWr letter, harry?"
he asked as he coun TED stitches.
harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
"good," said hagrid.
"there's a list there of everything  YEWh need."
harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read:

    "can we buy all this in lon DON?"
harry wondered aloud.
"if  YEWh know where to go," said hagrid.
harry had never been to lon DON before.
although hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.
he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
"i  DON't know how the muggles manage without magic," he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.
hagrid was so huge that he par TED the crowd easily; all harry had to do was keep close behind him.
they passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand.
this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.
could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?
were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?
might this not all be some huge joke that the  DURSLEYS had cooked up?
if harry hadn't known that the  DURSLEYS had no sense of humor, he might have thought so;  YEWt somehow, even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, harry couldn't help trusting him.
"this is it," said hagrid, coming to a halt, "the leaky cauldron.
it's a famous place."
it was a tiny, grubby-looking pub.
if hagrid hadn't poin TED it out, harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.
the people hurrying by didn't glance at it.
their e YEWs slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the leaky cauldron at all.
in fact, harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it.
before he could mention this, hagrid had steered him inside.
for a famous place, it was very dark and shabby.
a few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.
one of them was smoking a long pipe.
a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.
the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in.
everyone seemed to know hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "the usual, hagrid?"
"can't,  TOM, i'm on hogwarts business," said hagrid, clapping his great hand on harry's shoulder and making harry's knees buckle.
"good lord," said the bartender, peering at harry, "is this -- can this be --?"
the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
"bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, " HARRY_POTTER... what an honor."
he hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward harry and seized his hand, tears in his e YEWs.
"welcome back, mr.  POTTER, welcome back."
harry didn't know what to say.
everyone was looking at him.
the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
hagrid was beaming.
then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next  MOMent, harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldron.
" DORIS_CROCKFORD, mr.  POTTER, can't believe i'm meeting you at last."
"so proud, mr.  POTTER, i'm just so proud."
"always wan TED to shake your hand -- i'm all of a flutter."
"deligh TED, mr.  POTTER, just can't tell you,  DIGGLE's the name, dedalus  DIGGLE."
"i've seen you before!"
said harry, as dedalus  DIGGLE's top hat fell off in his excitement.
"you bowed to me once in a shop."
"he remembers!"
cried dedalus  DIGGLE, looking around at everyone.
"did you hear that?
he remembers me!"
harry shook hands again and again --  DORIS_CROCKFORD kept coming back for more.
a pale young man made his way forward, very nervously.
one of his e YEWs was twitching.
"professor  QUIRTELL!"
said hagrid.
"harry, professor  QUIRTELL will be one of your teachers at hogwarts."
"p-p- POTTER," stammered professor  QUIRTELL, grasping harry's hand, "c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased i am to meet you."
"what sort of magic do you teach, professor  QUIRTELL?"
"d-defense against the d-d-dark arts," muttered professor  QUIRTELL, as though he'd rather not think about it.
"n-not that you n-need it, eh, p-p- POTTER?"
he laughed nervously.
"you'll be g-getting all your equipment, i suppose?
i've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself."
he looked terrified at the very thought.
but the others wouldn't let professor  QUIRTELL keep harry to himself.
it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all.
at last, hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.
"must get on -- lots ter buy.
come on, harry."
 DORIS_CROCKFORD shook harry's hand one last time, and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
hagrid grinned at harry.
"told  YEWh, didn't i?
told  YEWh you was famous.
even professor  QUIRTELL was tremblin' ter meet  YEWh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'."
"is he always that nervous?"
"oh,  YEWah.
poor bloke.
brilliant mind.
he was fine while he was
    studyin' outta books but then he took a  YEWar off ter get some firsthand experience....
they say he met vampires in the black forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.
scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?"
vampires?
hags?
harry's head was swimming.
hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
"three up... two across he muttered.
"right, stand back, harry."
he tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
the brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twis TED and turned out of sight.
"welcome," said hagrid, "to  DIAGON_ALLEY."
he grinned at harry's amazement.
they stepped through the archway.
harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.
the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
cauldrons -- all sizes - copper, brass, pewter, silver -- self-stirring -- collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.
" YEWah, you'll be needin' one," said hagrid, "but we gotta get  YEWr money first."
harry wished he had about eight more e YEWs.
he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping.
a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, "dragon liver, seventeen  SICKLES an ounce, they're mad...."
    a low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium -- tawny, screech, barn,  BROWN, and snowy.
several boys of about harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.
"look," harry heard one of them say, "the new nimbus two thousand -- fastest ever --" there were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat sp LEE_JORDANns and eels' e YEWs, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....
    " GRINGOTTS," said hagrid.
they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops.
standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was -
    " YEWah, that's a goblin," said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him.
the goblin was about a head shorter than harry.
he had a swarthy, clever face, a poin TED beard and, harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.
he bowed as they walked inside.
now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:
    enter, stranger, but take heed
    of what awaits the sin of greed,
    for those who take, but do not earn,
    must pay most dearly in their turn.
so if you seek beneath our floors
    a treasure that was never yours,
    thief, you have been warned, beware
    of finding more than treasure there.
"like i said,  YEWh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said hagrid.
a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall.
about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through e YEWglasses.
there were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and  YEWt more goblins were showing people in and out of these.
hagrid and harry made for the counter.
"morning," said hagrid to a free goblin.
"we've come ter take some money outta mr.  HARRY_POTTER's safe."
"you have his key, sir?"
"got it here somewhere," said hagrid, and he star TED emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers.
the goblin wrinkled his nose.
harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.
"got it," said hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
the goblin looked at it closely.
"that seems to be in order."
"an' i've also got a letter here from professor  DUmbledore," said hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest.
"it's about the youknow-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen."
the goblin read the letter carefully.
"very well," he said, handing it back to hagrid, "i will have someone take you down to both vaults.
 GRIPHOOK!"
 GRIPHOOK was  YEWt another goblin.
once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and harry followed  GRIPHOOK toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
"what's the  YOU-KNOW-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen?"
harry asked.
"can't tell  YEWh that," said hagrid mysteriously.
"very secret.
hogwarts business.
 DUmbledore's trus TED me.
more'n my job's worth ter tell  YEWh that."
 GRIPHOOK held the door open for them.
harry, who had expec TED more marble, was surprised.
they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches.
it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor.
 GRIPHOOK whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them.
they climbed in -- hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.
at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.
harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.
the rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because  GRIPHOOK wasn't steering.
harry's e YEWs stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open.
once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twis TED around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
i never know," harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart, "what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"
"stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said hagrid.
"an'  DON' ask me questions just now, i think i'm gonna be sick."
he did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.
 GRIPHOOK unlocked the door.
a lot of green smoke came  BILLowing out, and as it cleared, harry gasped.
inside were mounds of gold coins.
columns of silver.
heaps of little bronze  KNUTS.
"all yours," smiled hagrid.
all harry's -- it was incredible.
the  DURSLEYS couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking.
how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep?
and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under lon DON.
hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag.
"the gold ones are galleons," he explained.
"seventeen silver  SICKLES to a galleon and twenty-nine  KNUTS to a sickle, it's easy enough.
right, that should be enough for a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for  YEWh."
he turned to  GRIPHOOK.
"vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?"
"one speed only," said  GRIPHOOK.
they were going even deeper now and gathering speed.
the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.
they went rattling over an underground ravine, and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bot TOM, but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
"stand back," said  GRIPHOOK importantly.
he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply mel TED away.
"if anyone but a  GRINGOTTS goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there," said  GRIPHOOK.
"how often do you check to see if anyone's inside?"
harry asked.
"about once every ten  YEWars," said  GRIPHOOK with a rather nasty grin.
something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty.
then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in  BROWN paper lying on the floor.
hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat.
harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.
"come on, back in this infernal cart, and  DON't talk to me on the way back, it's best if i keep me mouth shut," said hagrid.
one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside  GRINGOTTS.
harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money.
he didn't have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life -- more money than even  DUdley had ever had.
"might as well get  YEWr uniform," said hagrid, nodding toward  MADAM_MALKIN's robes for all occasions.
"listen, harry, would  YEWh mind if i slipped off for a pick-me-up in the leaky cauldron?
i hate them  GRINGOTTS carts."
he did still look a bit sick, so harry entered  MADAM_MALKIN's shop alone, feeling nervous.
 MADAM_MALKIN was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
"hogwarts, clear?"
she said, when harry star TED to speak.
"got the lot here -- another young man being fit TED up just now, in fact. "
in the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, poin TED face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.
 MADAM_MALKIN stood harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.
"hello," said the boy, "hogwarts, too?"
" YEWs," said harry.
"my father's  NEXT_DOOR buying my books and  MOTHER's up the street looking at wands," said the boy.
he had a bored, drawling voice.
"then i'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms.
i  DON't see why first  YEWars can't have their own.
i think i'll bully father into getting me one and i'll smuggle it in somehow."
harry was strongly reminded of  DUdley.
"have you got your own broom?"
the boy went on.
"no," said harry.
"play quidditch at all?"
"no," harry said again, wondering what on earth quidditch could be.
"i do -- father says it's a crime if i'm not picked to play for my house, and i must say, i agree.
know what house you'll be in  YEWt?"
"no," said harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
"well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but i know i'll be in  SLYTHERINS, all our family have been -- imagine being in  HUFFLEPUFFS, i think i'd leave, wouldn't you?"
"mmm," said harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.
"i say, look at that man!"
said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window.
hagrid was standing there, grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
"that's hagrid," said harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
"he works at hogwarts."
"oh," said the boy, "i've heard of him.
he's a sort of servant, isn't he?"
"he's the gamekeeper," said harry.
he was liking the boy less and less every second.
" YEWs, exactly.
i heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed."
"i think he's brilliant," said harry coldly.
"do you?"
said the boy, with a slight sneer.
"why is he with you?
where are your parents?"
"they're dead," said harry shortly.
he didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy.
"oh, sorry," said the other,.
not sounding sorry at all.
"but they were our kind, weren't they?"
"they were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
"i really  DON't think they should let the other sort in, do you?
they're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways.
some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine.
i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.
what's your surname, anyway?"
but before harry could answer,  MADAM_MALKIN said, "that's you  DONe, my dear," and harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.
"well, i'll see you at hogwarts, i suppose," said the drawling boy.
harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
"what's up?"
said hagrid.
"nothing," harry lied.
they stopped to buy parchment and quills.
harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.
when they had left the shop, he said, "hagrid, what's quidditch?"
"blimey, harry, i keep forgettin' how little  YEWh know -- not knowin' about quidditch!"
" DON't make me feel worse," said harry.
he told hagrid about the pate boy in  MADAM_MALKIN's.
    "
--and he said people from muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in."
" YEWr not from a muggle family.
if he'd known who  YEWh were -- he's grown up knowin'  YEWr name if his parents are wizardin' folk.
you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw  YEWh.
anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0' muggles -- look at  YEWr mum!
look what she had for a sister!"
"so what is quidditch?"
"it's our sport.
wizard sport.
it's like -- like soccer in the muggle world -- everyone follows quidditch -- pla YEWd up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
"and what are  SLYTHERINS and  HUFFLEPUFFS?"
"school houses.
there's four.
everyone says  HUFFLEPUFFS are a lot o'  DUffers, but --"
    "i bet i'm in  HUFFLEPUFFS" said harry gloomily.
"better  HUFFLEPUFFS than  SLYTHERINS," said hagrid darkly.
"there's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in  SLYTHERINS.
 YOU-KNOW-who was one."
"vol-, sorry -  YOU-KNOW-who was at hogwarts?"
" YEWars an'  YEWars ago," said hagrid.
they bought harry's school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all.
even  DUdley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.
hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses (bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges: hair loss, jelly-legs, tongue- tying and much, much more) by professor  VINDICTUS_VIRIDIAN.
"i was trying to find out how to curse  DUdley."
"i'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but  YEWr not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances," said hagrid.
"an' anyway,  YEWh couldn' work any of them curses  YEWt,  YEWh'll need a lot more study before  YEWh get ter that level."
hagrid wouldn't let harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("it says pewter on  YEWr list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion in GREDients and a collapsible brass telescope.
then they visi TED the apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rot TED cabbages.
barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of  FANGs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.
while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion in GREDients for harry, harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle e YEWs (five  KNUTS a scoop).
outside the apothecary, hagrid checked harry's list again.
"just  YEWr wand left - a  YEWah, an' i still haven't got  YEWh a birthday present."
harry felt himself go red.
"you  DON't have to --"
    "i know i  DON't have to.
tell  YEWh what, i'll get  YEWr animal.
not a toad, toads went outta fashion  YEWars ago,  YEWh'd be laughed at - an' i  DON' like cats, they make me sneeze.
i'll get  YEWr an owl.
all the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry  YEWr mail an' everythin'."
twenty minutes later, they left eeylops owl emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright e YEWs.
harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast as LEE_JORDANp with her head under her wing.
he couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like professor  QUIRTELL.
" DON' mention it," said hagrid gruffly.
" DON' expect you've had a lotta presents from them  DURSLEYS.
just  OLLIVANDERs left now - only place for wands,  OLLIVANDERs, and  YEWh gotta have the best wand."
a magic wand... this was what harry had been really looking forward to.
the last shop was narrow and shabby.
peeling gold letters over the door read  OLLIVANDERs: makers of fine wands since 382 b.c.
a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the  DUsty window.
a tinkling  CHASER_KATIE_BELL rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside.
it was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait.
harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
for some reason, the back of his neck prickled.
the very  DUst and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
"good afternoon," said a soft voice.
harry jumped.
hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.
an old man was standing before them, his wide, pale e YEWs shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.
"hello," said harry awkwardly.
"ah  YEWs," said the man.
" YEWs,  YEWs.
i thought i'd be seeing you soon.
 HARRY_POTTER."
it wasn't a question.
"you have your  MOTHER's e YEWs.
it seems only  YEWsterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.
ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.
nice wand for charm work."
mr.  OLLIVANDER moved closer to harry.
harry wished he would blink.
those silvery e YEWs were a bit creepy.
"your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.
eleven inches.
pliable.
a little more power and excellent for transfiguration.
well, i say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course."
mr.  OLLIVANDER had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose.
harry could see himself reflec TED in those misty e YEWs.
"and that's where..."
    mr.  OLLIVANDER touched the lightning scar on harry's forehead with a long, white finger.
"i'm sorry to say i sold the wand that did it," he said softly.
"thirteen-and-a-half inches.
 YEW.
powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if i'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do...."
    he shook his head and then, to harry's relief, spot TED hagrid.
"rubeus!
 MR._HAGRID!
how nice to see you again....  OAK, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
"it was, sir,  YEWs," said hagrid.
"good wand, that one.
but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?"
said mr.  OLLIVANDER, suddenly stern.
"er --  YEWs, they did,  YEWs," said hagrid, shuffling his feet.
"i've still got the pieces, though," he added brightly.
"but you  DON't use them?"
said mr.  OLLIVANDER sharply.
"oh, no, sit," said hagrid quickly.
harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
"hmmm," said mr.  OLLIVANDER, giving hagrid a piercing look.
"well, now -- mr.  POTTER.
let me see."
he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket.
"which is your wand arm?"
"er -- well, i'm right-handed," said harry.
"hold out your arm.
that's it."
he measured harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.
as he measured, he said, "every  OLLIVANDER wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, mr.  POTTER.
we use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons.
no two  OLLIVANDER wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.
and of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand."
harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own.
mr.  OLLIVANDER was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
"that will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor.
"right then, mr.  POTTER.
try this one.
 BEECHWOOD and dragon heartstring.
nine inches.
nice and flexible.
just take it and give it a wave."
harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but mr.  OLLIVANDER snatched it out of his hand almost at once.
"maple and phoenix feather.
seven inches.
quite whippy.
try --"
    harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by mr.  OLLIVANDER.
"no, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
go on, go on, try it out."
harry tried.
and tried.
he had no idea what mr.  OLLIVANDER was waiting for.
the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands mr.  OLLIVANDER pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
"tricky cus TOMer, eh?
not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- i wonder, now - -  YEWs, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
harry took the wand.
he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.
he raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the  DUsty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.
hagrid whooped and clapped and mr.  OLLIVANDER cried, "oh, bravo!
 YEWs, indeed, oh, very good.
well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "
    he put harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in  BROWN paper, still muttering, "curious... curious..
    "sorry," said harry, "but what's curious?"
mr.  OLLIVANDER fixed harry with his pale stare.
"i remember every wand i've ever sold, mr.  POTTER.
every single wand.
it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other.
it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar."
harry swallowed.
" YEWs, thirteen-and-a-half inches.
 YEW.
curious indeed how these things happen.
the wand chooses the wizard, remember....
i think we must expect great things from you, mr.  POTTER.... after all, he- who-must-not-be-named did great things -- terrible,  YEWs, but great."
harry shivered.
he wasn't sure he liked mr.  OLLIVANDER too much.
he paid seven gold galleons for his wand, and mr.  OLLIVANDER bowed them from his shop.
the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down  DIAGON_ALLEY, back through the wall, back through the leaky cauldron, now empty.
harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl as LEE_JORDANp in its cage on harry's lap.
up another escalator, out into paddington station; harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.
"got time for a bite to eat before  YEWr train leaves," he said.
he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them.
harry kept looking around.
everything looked so strange, somehow.
"you all right, harry?
 YEWr very quiet," said hagrid.
harry wasn't sure he could explain.
he'd just had the best birthday of his life -- and  YEWt -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.
"everyone thinks i'm special," he said at last.
"all those people in the leaky cauldron, professor  QUIRTELL, mr.  OLLIVANDER... but i  DON't know anything about magic at all.
how can they expect great things?
i'm famous and i can't even remember what i'm famous for.
i  DON't know what happened when vol-, sorry -- i mean, the night my parents died."
hagrid leaned across the table.
behind the wild beard and e YEWbrows he wore a very kind smile.
" DON' you worry, harry.
you'll learn fast enough.
everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts, you'll be just fine.
just be  YEWrself.
i know it's hard.
 YEWh've been singled out, an' that's always hard.
but  YEWh'll have a great time at hogwarts -- i did -- still do, 'smatter of fact."
hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the  DURSLEYS, then handed him an envelope.
" YEWr ticket for hogwarts, " he said.
"first o' september -- king's cross -- it's all on  YEWr ticket.
any problems with the  DURSLEYS, send me a letter with  YEWr owl, she'll know where to find me.... see  YEWh soon, harry."
the train pulled out of the station.
harry wan TED to watch hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and hagrid had gone.
chapter six.
the journey from platform nine and three-quarters.
harry's last month with the  DURSLEYS wasn't fun.
true,  DUdley was now so scared of harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while  AUNT_PETUNIA and  UNCLE_VERNON didn't shut harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
half terrified, half furious, they ac TED as though any chair with harry in it were empty.
although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.
harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company.
he had decided to call her  HEDWIG, a name he had found in a history of magic.
his school books were very interesting.
he lay on his bed reading late into the night,  HEDWIG swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased.
it was lucky that  AUNT_PETUNIA didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because  HEDWIG kept bringing back dead mice.
every night before he went to s LEE_JORDANp, harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to september the first.
on the last day of august he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king's cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.
he cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and  DUdley screamed and ran from the room.
"er --  UNCLE_VERNON?"
 UNCLE_VERNON grun TED to show he was listening.
"er -- i need to be at king's cross  TOMorrow to -- to go to hogwarts."
 UNCLE_VERNON grun TED again.
"would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"
grunt.
harry supposed that meant  YEWs.
"thank you."
he was about to go back upstairs when  UNCLE_VERNON actually spoke.
"funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train.
magic carpets all got punctures, have they?"
harry didn't say anything.
"where is this school, anyway?"
"i  DON't know," said harry, realizing this for the first time.
he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
"i just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock," he read.
his aunt and uncle stared.
"platform what?"
"nine and three-quarters."
" DON't talk rubbish," said  UNCLE_VERNON.
"there is no platform nine and three-quarters."
"it's on my ticket."
"barking," said  UNCLE_VERNON, "howling mad, the lot of them.
you'll see.
you just wait.
all right, we'll take you to king's cross.
we're going up to lon DON  TOMorrow anyway, or i wouldn't bother."
"why are you going to lon DON?"
harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.
"taking  DUdley to the hospital," growled  UNCLE_VERNON.
"got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to  SMELTINGS."
harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too exci TED and nervous to go back to s LEE_JORDANp.
he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd change on the train.
he checked his hogwarts list  YEWt again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that  HEDWIG was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the  DURSLEYS to get up.
two hours later, harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the  DURSLEYS' car,  AUNT_PETUNIA had talked  DUdley into sitting next to harry, and they had set off.
they reached king's cross at half past ten.
 UNCLE_VERNON  DUmped harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.
harry thought this was strangely kind until  UNCLE_VERNON stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.
"well, there you are, boy.
platform nine -- platform ten.
your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they  DON't seem to have built it  YEWt, do they?"
he was quite right, of course.
there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.
"have a good term," said  UNCLE_VERNON with an even nastier smile.
he left without another word.
harry turned and saw the  DURSLEYS drive away.
all three of them were laughing.
harry's mouth went rather dry.
what on earth was he going to do?
he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of  HEDWIG.
he'd have to ask someone.
he stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters.
the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he star TED to get anno YEWd, as though harry was being stupid on purpose.
getting desperate, harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but the guard said there wasn't one.
in the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters.
harry was now trying hard not to panic.
according to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into  DIAGON_ALLEY.
he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
at that  MOMent a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.
    "
-- packed with muggles, of course --"
    harry swung round.
the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.
each of them was pushing a trunk like harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.
heart hammering, harry pushed his cart after them.
they stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
"now, what's the platform number?"
said the boys'  MOTHER.
"nine and three-quarters!"
piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, " MOM, can't i go... "
    "you're not old enough,  GINNY_WEASLEY, now be quiet.
all right,  PERCY_WEASLEY, you go first."
what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
" FRED_WEASLEY, you next," the plump woman said.
"i'm not  FRED_WEASLEY, i'm  GEORGE_WEASLEY," said the boy.
"honestly, woman, you call yourself our  MOTHER?
cara you tell i'm  GEORGE_WEASLEY?"
"sorry,  GEORGE_WEASLEY, dear."
"only joking, i am  FRED_WEASLEY," said the boy, and off he went.
his twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have  DONe so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he  DONe it?
now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.
there was nothing else for it.
"excuse me," harry said to the plump woman.
"hello, dear," she said.
"first time at hogwarts?
ron's new, too."
she poin TED at the last and youngest of her sons.
he was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
" YEWs," said harry.
"the thing is -- the thing is, i  DON't know how to --"
    "how to get onto the platform?"
she said kindly, and harry nodded.
"not to worry," she said.
"all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten.
 DON't stop and  DON't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important.
best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
go on, go now before ron."
"er -- okay," said harry.
he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier.
it looked very solid.
he star TED to walk toward it.
people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten.
harry walked more quickly.
he was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his e YEWs ready for the crash --
    it didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his e YEWs.
a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.
a sign overhead said hogwarts express, eleven o'clock.
harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words platform nine and three-quarters on it, he had  DONe it.
smoke from the engine drif TED over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.
owls hoo TED to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.
the first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.
harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
he passed a round-faced boy who was saying, " GRAN, i've lost my toad again."
"oh,  MR._LONGBOTTOM," he heard the old woman sigh.
a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
"give us a look,  LEE_JORDAN, go on."
the boy lif TED the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and  YEWlled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train.
he put  HEDWIG inside first and then star TED to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.
he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.
"want a hand?"
it was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier.
" YEWs, please," harry pan TED.
"oy,  FRED_WEASLEY!
c'mere and help!"
with the twins' help, harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.
"thanks," said harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his e YEWs.
"what's that?"
said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at harry's lightning scar.
"blimey," said the other twin.
"are you
    "he is," said the first twin.
"aren't you?"
he added to harry.
"what?"
said harry.
" HARRY_POTTER, "chorused the twins.
"oh, him," said harry.
"i mean,  YEWs, i am."
the two boys gawked at him, and harry felt himself turning red.
then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.
" FRED_WEASLEY?
 GEORGE_WEASLEY?
are you there?"
"coming,  MOM."
with a last look at harry, the twins hopped off the train.
harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying.
their  MOTHER had just taken out her handkerchief.
"ron, you've got something on your nose."
the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.
" MOM -- geroff" he wriggled free.
"aaah, has ickle  RONNIE got somefink on his nosie?"
said one of the twins.
"shut up," said ron.
"where's  PERCY_WEASLEY?"
said their  MOTHER.
"he's coming now."
the oldest boy came striding into sight.
he had already changed into his  BILLowing black hogwarts robes, and harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter p on it.
"can't stay long,  MOTHER," he said.
"i'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --"
    "oh, are you a prefect,  PERCY_WEASLEY?"
said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise.
"you should have said something, we had no idea."
"hang on, i think i remember him saying something about it," said the other twin.
"once --"
    "or twice --"
    "a minute --"
    "all summer --"
    "oh, shut up," said  PERCY_WEASLEY the prefect.
"how come  PERCY_WEASLEY gets new robes, anyway?"
said one of the twins.
"because he's a prefect," said their  MOTHER fondly.
"all right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there."
she kissed  PERCY_WEASLEY on the cheek and he left.
then she turned to the twins.
"now, you two -- this  YEWar, you behave yourselves.
if i get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"
    "blown up a toilet?
we've never blown up a toilet."
"great idea though, thanks,  MOM."
"it's not funny.
and look after ron."
" DON't worry, ickle  RONNIEkins is safe with us."
"shut up," said ron again.
he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his  MOTHER had rubbed it.
"hey,  MOM, guess what?
guess who we just met on the train?"
harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.
"you know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?
know who he is?"
"who?"
" HARRY_POTTER!"
harry heard the little girl's voice.
"oh,  MOM, can i go on the train and see him,  MOM, eh please...."
    "you've already seen him,  GINNY_WEASLEY, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.
is he really,  FRED_WEASLEY?
how do you know?"
"asked him.
saw his scar.
it's really there - like lightning."
"poor dear - no wonder he was alone, i wondered.
he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform."
"never mind that, do you think he remembers what  YOU-KNOW-who looks like?"
their  MOTHER suddenly became very stern.
"i forbid you to ask him,  FRED_WEASLEY.
no,  DON't you dare.
as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school."
"all right, keep your hair on."
a whistle sounded.
"hurry up!"
their  MOTHER said, and the three boys clambered onto the train.
they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-b YEW, and their younger sister began to cry.
" DON't,  GINNY_WEASLEY, we'll send you loads of owls."
"we'll send you a hogwarts toilet seat."
" GEORGE_WEASLEY!"
"only joking,  MOM."
the train began to move.
harry saw the boys'  MOTHER waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
harry watched the girl and her  MOTHER disappear as the train rounded the corner.
houses flashed past the window.
harry felt a great leap of excitement.
he didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.
the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.
"anyone sitting there?"
he asked, pointing at the seat opposite harry.
"everywhere else is full."
harry shook his head and the boy sat down.
he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked.
harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.
"hey, ron."
the twins were back.
"listen, we're going down the middle of the train --  LEE_JORDAN's got a giant tarantula down there."
"right," mumbled ron.
"harry," said the other twin, "did we intro DUce ourselves?
 FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY.
and this is ron, our brother.
see you later, then.
"b YEW," said harry and ron.
the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.
"are you really  HARRY_POTTER?"
ron blur TED out.
harry nodded.
"oh -well, i thought it might be one of  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY's jokes," said ron.
"and have you really got -- you know..."
    he poin TED at harry's forehead.
harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar.
ron stared.
"so that's where  YOU-KNOW-who
    " YEWs," said harry, "but i can't remember it."
"nothing?"
said ron eagerly.
"well -- i remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."
"wow," said ron.
he sat and stared at harry for a few  MOMents, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.
"are all your family wizards?"
asked harry, who found ron just as interesting as ron found him.
"er --  YEWs, i think so," said ron.
"i think  MOM's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
"so you must know loads of magic already."
the  MRS._WEASLEY were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in  DIAGON_ALLEY had talked about.
"i heard you went to live with muggles," said ron.
"what are they like?"
"horrible -well, not all of them.
my aunt and uncle and cousin are, though.
wish i'd had three wizard brothers."
"five," said ron.
for some reason, he was looking gloomy.
"i'm the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts.
you could say i've got a lot to live up to.
 BILL and charlie have already left --  BILL was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch.
now  PERCY_WEASLEY's a prefect.
 FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny.
everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if i do, it's no big deal, because they did it first.
you never get anything new, either, with five brothers.
i've got  BILL's old robes, charlie's old wand, and  PERCY_WEASLEY's old rat."
ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was as LEE_JORDANp.
"his name's  SCABBERS and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up.
 PERCY_WEASLEY got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- i mean, i got  SCABBERS instead."
ron's ears went pink.
he seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.
harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.
after all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told ron so, all about having to wear  DUdley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
this seemed to cheer ron up.
"... and until hagrid told me, i didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or  VOLDEMORT"
    ron gasped.
"what?"
said harry.
"you said  YOU-KNOW-who's name!"
said ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.
"i'd have thought you, of all people --"
    "i'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said harry, i just never knew you shouldn't.
see what i mean?
i've got loads to learn....
i bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, "i bet i'm the worst in the class."
"you won't be.
there's loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough."
while they had been talking, the train had carried them out of lon DON.
now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.
they were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, "anything off the cart, dears?"
harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches.
harry went out into the corridor.
he had never had any money for candy with the  DURSLEYS, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have mars bars.
what she did have were  BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans, drooble's best blowing gum, chocolate frogs.
pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, licorice wands, and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life.
not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver  SICKLES and seven bronze  KNUTS.
ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.
"hungry, are you?"
"starving," said harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it.
there were four sandwiches inside.
he pulled one of them apart and said, "she always forgets i  DON't like corned beef."
"swap you for one of these," said harry, holding up a pasty.
"go on --"
    "you  DON't want this, it's all dry," said ron.
"she hasn't got much time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us."
"go on, have a pasty," said harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
it was a nice feeling, sitting there with ron, eating their way through all harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
"what are these?"
harry asked ron, holding up a pack of chocolate frogs.
"they're not really frogs, are they?"
he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.
"no," said ron.
"but see what the card is.
i'm missing  AGRIPPA."
"what?"
"oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- chocolate frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards.
i've got about five hundred, but i haven't got  AGRIPPA or ptolemy."
harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card.
it showed a man's face.
he wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache.
underneath the picture was the name  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
"so this is  DUmbledore!"
said harry.
" DON't tell me you'd never heard of  DUmbledore!"
said ron.
"can i have a frog?
i might get  AGRIPPA -- thanks
    harry turned over his card and read:
     ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE
    currently headmaster of hogwarts
    considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,  DUmbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner,  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel.
professor  DUmbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that  DUmbledore's face had disappeared.
"he's gone!"
"well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said ron.
"he'll be back.
no, i've got  MORGANA again and i've got about six of her... do you want it?
you can start collecting."
ron's e YEWs stra YEWd to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped.
"help yourself," said harry.
"but in, you know, the muggle world, people just stay put in photos."
"do they?
what, they  DON't move at all?"
ron sounded amazed.
"weird!"
harry stared as  DUmbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.
ron was more interes TED in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards, but harry couldn't keep his e YEWs off them.
soon he had not only  DUmbledore and  MORGANA, but  HENGIST of  WOODcroft,  ALBERIC_GRUNNION, circe, paracelsus, and  MERLIN.
he finally tore his e YEWs away from the druidess  CLIODNA, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of  BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans.
"you want to be careful with those," ron warned harry.
"when they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe.
 GEORGE_WEASLEY reckons he had a booger- flavored one once."
ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.
"bleaaargh -- see?
sprouts."
they had a good time eating the every flavor beans.
harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.
the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.
the neat fields had gone.
now there were  WOODs, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.
there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in.
he looked tearful.
"sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"
when they shook their heads, he wailed, "i've lost him!
he keeps getting away from me!"
"he'll turn up," said harry.
" YEWs," said the boy miserably.
"well, if you see him..."
    he left.
" DON't know why he's so bothered," said ron.
"if i'd brought a toad i'd lose it as quick as i could.
mind you, i brought  SCABBERS, so i can't talk."
the rat was still snoozing on ron's lap.
"he might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said ron in disgust.
"i tried to turn him  YEWllow  YEWsterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work.
i'll show you, look..."
    he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand.
it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.
"unicorn hair's nearly poking out.
anyway
    he had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again.
the toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him.
she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes.
"has anyone seen a toad?
 MR._LONGBOTTOM's lost one," she said.
she had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy  BROWN hair, and rather large front teeth.
"we've already told him we haven't seen it," said ron, but the girl wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.
"oh, are you doing magic?
let's see it, then."
she sat down.
ron looked taken aback.
"er -- all right."
he cleared his throat.
"sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat  YEWllow."
he waved his wand, but nothing happened.
 SCABBERS sta YEWd gray and fast as LEE_JORDANp.
"are you sure that's a real spell?"
said the girl.
"well, it's not very good, is it?
i've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me.
nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter, but i was ever so pleased, of course, i mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, i've heard -- i've learned all our course books by heart, of course, i just hope it will be enough -- i'm  HERMIONE_GRANGER, by the way, who are you.
she said all this very fast.
harry looked at ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.
"i'm  MR._RON," ron muttered.
" HARRY_POTTER," said harry.
"are you really?"
said  HERMLONE.
"i know all about you, of course -- i got a few extra books.
for background reading, and you're in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century.
"am i?"
said harry, feeling dazed.
"goodness, didn't you know, i'd have found out everything i could if it was me," said  HERMLONE.
"do either of you know what house you'll be in?
i've been asking around, and i hope i'm in  GRYFFINDOR, it sounds by far the best; i hear  DUmbledore himself was in it, but i suppose  RAVENCLAW wouldn't be too bad....
anyway, we'd better go and look for  MR._LONGBOTTOM's toad.
you two had better change, you know, i expect we'll be there soon."
and she left, taking the toadless boy with her.
"whatever house i'm in, i hope she's not in it," said ron.
he threw his wand back into his trunk.
"stupid spell --  GEORGE_WEASLEY gave it to me, bet he knew it was a  DUd."
"what house are your brothers in?"
asked harry.
" GRYFFINDOR," said ron.
gloom seemed to be settling on him again.
" MOM and dad were in it, too.
i  DON't know what they'll say if i'm not.
i  DON't suppose  RAVENCLAW would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in  SLYTHERINS."
"that's the house vol-, i mean,  YOU-KNOW-who was in?"
" YEWah," said ron.
he flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
"you know, i think the ends of  SCABBERS' whiskers are a bit lighter," said harry, trying to take ron's mind off houses.
"so what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"
harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.
"charlie's in romania studying dragons, and  BILL's in africa doing something for  GRINGOTTS," said ron.
"did you hear about
     GRINGOTTS?
it's been all over the daily  PROPHET, but i  DON't suppose you get that with the muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault."
harry stared.
"really?
what happened to them?"
"nothing, that's why it's such big news.
they haven't been caught.
my dad says it must've been a powerful dark wizard to get round  GRINGOTTS, but they  DON't think they took anything, that's what's odd.
'course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case  YOU-KNOW-who's behind it."
harry turned this news over in his mind.
he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you-  KNOW-WHO was mentioned.
he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying " VOLDEMORT" without worrying.
"what's your quidditch team?"
ron asked.
"er -- i  DON't know any," harry confessed.
"what!"
ron looked  DUmbfounded.
"oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --" and he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven pla YEWrs, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money.
he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open  YEWt again, but it wasn't  MR._LONGBOTTOM the toadless boy, or  HERMIONE_GRANGER this time.
three boys entered, and harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from  MADAM_MALKIN's robe shop.
he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in  DIAGON_ALLEY.
"is it true?"
he said.
"they're saying all down the train that  HARRY_POTTER's in this compartment.
so it's you, is it?"
" YEWs," said harry.
he was looking at the other boys.
both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean.
standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.
"oh, this is  CRABBE and this is  GOYLE," said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where harry was looking.
"and my name's  MALFOY, draco  MALFOY."
ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget.
draco  MALFOY looked at him.
"think my name's funny, do you?
no need to ask who you are.
my father told me all the  MRS._WEASLEY have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford."
he turned back to harry.
"you'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others,  POTTER.
you  DON't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
i can help you there."
he held out his hand to shake harry's, but harry didn't take it.
"i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said coolly.
draco  MALFOY didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.
"i'd be careful if i were you,  POTTER," he said slowly.
"unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents.
they didn't know what was good for them, either.
you hang around with riffraff like the  MRS._WEASLEY and that hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
both harry and ron stood up.
"say that again," ron said, his face as red as his hair.
"oh, you're going to fight us, are you?"
 MALFOY sneered.
"unless you get out now," said harry, more bravely than he felt, because  CRABBE and  GOYLE were a lot bigger than him or ron.
"but we  DON't feet like leaving, do we, boys?
we've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some."
 GOYLE reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron - ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched  GOYLE,  GOYLE let out a horrible  YEWll.
 SCABBERS the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into  GOYLE's knuckle -  CRABBE and  MALFOY backed away as  GOYLE swung  SCABBERS round and round, howling, and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once.
perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later,  HERMIONE_GRANGER had come in.
"what has been going on?"
she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up  SCABBERS by his tail.
i think he's been knocked out," ron said to harry.
he looked closer at  SCABBERS.
"no -- i  DON't believe it -- he's gone back to s LEE_JORDANp-"
    and so he had.
"you've met  MALFOY before?"
harry explained about their meeting in  DIAGON_ALLEY.
"i've heard of his family," said ron darkly.
"they were some of the first to come back to our side after  YOU-KNOW-who disappeared.
said they'd been bewitched.
my dad doesn't believe it.
he says  MALFOY's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the dark side."
he turned to  HERMLONE.
"can we help you with something?"
"you'd better hurry up and put your robes on, i've just been up to the front to ask the con DUctor, and he says we're nearly there.
you haven't been fighting, have you?
you'll be in trouble before we even get there!"
" SCABBERS has been fighting, not us," said ron, scowling at her.
"would you mind leaving while we change?"
"all right -- i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said  HERMLONE in a sniffy voice.
"and you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?"
ron glared at her as she left.
harry peered out of the window.
it was getting dark.
he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky.
the train did seem to be slowing down.
he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.
ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.
a voice echoed through the train: "we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes' time.
please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately."
harry's s TOMach lurched with nerves and ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles.
they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
the train slowed right down and finally stopped.
people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.
harry shivered in the cold night air.
then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and harry heard a familiar voice: "firs'  YEWars!
firs'  YEWars over here!
all right there, harry?"
hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
"c'mon, follow me -- any more firs'  YEWars?
mind  YEWr step, now!
firs'  YEWars follow me!"
slipping and stumbling, they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.
it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there.
nobody spoke much.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.
" YEW' all get  YEWr firs' sight o' hogwarts in a sec," hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."
there was a loud "oooooh!"
the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.
perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
"no more'n four to a boat!"
hagrid called, pointing to a f LEE_JORDANt of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.
harry and ron were followed into their boat by  MR._LONGBOTTOM and  HERMLONE.
"everyone in?"
shou TED hagrid, who had a boat to himself.
"right then -- forward!"
and the f LEE_JORDANt of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass.
everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead.
it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
"heads down!"
 YEWlled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.
they were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
"oy, you there!
is this your toad?"
said hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.
" TREVOR!"
cried  MR._LONGBOTTOM blissfully, holding out his hands.
then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge,  OAK front door.
"everyone here?
you there, still got  YEWr toad?"
hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.
chapter seven.
the sorting hat.
the door swung open at once.
a tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.
she had a very stern face and harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.
"the firs'  YEWars, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL," said hagrid.
"thank you, hagrid.
i will take them from here."
she pulled the door wide.
the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the  DURSLEYS' house in it.
the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at  GRINGOTTS, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.
they followed professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL across the flagged stone floor.
harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL showed the first  YEWars into a small, empty chamber off the hall.
they crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have  DONe, peering about nervously.
"welcome to hogwarts," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"the start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the great hall, you will be sor TED into your houses.
the sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within hogwarts.
you will have classes with the rest of your house, s LEE_JORDANp in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.
"the four houses are called  GRYFFINDOR,  HUFFLEPUFFS,  RAVENCLAW, and  SLYTHERINS.
each house has its own noble history and each has pro DUced outstanding witches and wizards.
while you are at hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points.
at the end of the  YEWar, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor.
i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.
"the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.
i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting."
her e YEWs lingered for a  MOMent on  MR._LONGBOTTOM's cl OAK, which was fastened under his left ear, and on ron's smudged nose.
harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.
"i shall return when we are ready for you," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"please wait quietly."
she left the chamber.
harry swallowed.
"how exactly do they sort us into houses?"
he asked ron.
"some sort of test, i think.
 FRED_WEASLEY said it hurts a lot, but i think he was joking."
harry's heart gave a horrible jolt.
a test?
in front of the whole school?
but he didn't know any magic  YEWt -- what on earth would he have to do?
he hadn't expec TED something like this the  MOMent they arrived.
he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.
no one was talking much except  HERMIONE_GRANGER, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need.
harry tried hard not to listen to her.
he'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the  DURSLEYS saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.
he kept his e YEWs fixed on the door.
any second now, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL would come back and lead him to his doom.
then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.
"what the --?"
he gasped.
so did the people around him.
about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall.
pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first  YEWars.
they seemed to be arguing.
what looked like a fat little monk was saying: "forgive and forget, i say, we ought to give him a second chance --"
    "my dear friar, haven't we given peeves all the chances he deserves?
he gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- i say, what are you all doing here?"
a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first  YEWars.
nobody answered.
"new students!"
said the fat friar, smiling around at them.
"about to be sor TED, i suppose?"
a few people nodded mutely.
"hope to see you in  HUFFLEPUFFS!"
said the friar.
"my old house, you know."
"move along now," said a sharp voice.
"the sorting ceremony's about to start."
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had returned.
one by one, the ghosts floa TED away through the opposite wall.
"now, form a line," professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL told the first  YEWars, "and follow me."
feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the great hall.
harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.
it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.
these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.
at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL led the first  YEWars up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.
the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.
dot TED here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.
mainly to avoid all the staring e YEWs, harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dot TED with stars.
he heard
     HERMLONE whisper, "its bewitched to look like the sky outside.
i read about it in hogwarts, a history."
it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the great hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.
harry quickly looked down again as professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first  YEWars.
on top of the stool she put a poin TED wizard's hat.
this hat was patched and fra YEWd and extremely dirty.
 AUNT_PETUNIA wouldn't have let it in the house.
maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.
for a few seconds, there was complete silence.
then the hat twitched.
a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:
    "oh, you may not think i'm pretty,
    but  DON't judge on what you see,
    i'll eat myself if you can find
    a smarter hat than me.
you can keep your bowlers black,
    your top hats s LEE_JORDANk and tall,
    for i'm the hogwarts sorting hat
    and i can cap them all.
there's nothing hidden in your head
    the sorting hat can't see,
    so try me on and i will tell you
    where you ought to be.
you might belong in  GRYFFINDOR,
    where dwell the brave at heart,
    their daring, nerve, and chivalry set  GRYFFINDORs apart;
    you might belong in  HUFFLEPUFFS,
    where they are just and loyal,
    those patient  HUFFLEPUFFS are true and unafraid of toil;
    or  YEWt in wise old  RAVENCLAW,
    if you've a ready mind,
    where those of wit and learning,
    will always find their kind;
    or perhaps in  SLYTHERINS
    you'll make your real friends,
    those cunning folk use any means
    to achieve their ends.
so put me on!
 DON't be afraid!
and  DON't get in a flap!
you're in safe hands (though i have none)
    for i'm a thinking cap!"
the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.
it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
"so we've just got to try on the hat!"
ron whispered to harry.
"i'll kill  FRED_WEASLEY, he was going on about wrestling a troll."
harry.
smiled weakly.
 YEWs, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.
the hat seemed to be asking rather alot; harry didn't feel brave or quick-wit TED or any of it at the  MOMent.
if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.
"when i call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sor TED," she said.
" ABBOTT,  HANNAH!"
a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her e YEWs, and sat down.
a  MOMents pause --
    " HUFFLEPUFFS!"
shou TED the hat.
the table on the right cheered and clapped as  HANNAH went to sit down at the  HUFFLEPUFFS table.
harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her.
"bones,  SUSAN!"
" HUFFLEPUFFS!"
shou TED the hat again, and  SUSAN scuttled off to sit next to  HANNAH.
"boot,  TERRY!"
" RAVENCLAW!"
the table second from the left clapped this time; several  RAVENCLAWs stood up to shake hands with  TERRY as he joined them.
    "
 BROCKLEHURST,  MANDY" went to  RAVENCLAW too, but " BROWN, lavender" became the first new  GRYFFINDOR, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; harry could see ron's twin brothers catcalling.
"bulstrode,  MILLICENT" then became a  SLYTHERINS.
perhaps it was harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about  SLYTHERINS, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
he was starting to feel definitely sick now.
he remembered being picked for teams  DUring gym at his old school.
he had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wan TED  DUdley to think they liked him.
"finch-fletchley,  JUSTIN!"
" HUFFLEPUFFS!"
sometimes, harry noticed, the hat shou TED out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide.
" SEAMUS_FINNIGAN,  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN," the sandy-haired boy next to harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a  GRYFFINDOR.
" GRANger,  HERMLONE!"
 HERMLONE almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
" GRYFFINDOR!"
shou TED the hat.
ron groaned.
a horrible thought struck harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous.
what if he wasn't chosen at all?
what if he just sat there with the hat over his e YEWs for ages, until professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
when  MR._LONGBOTTOM longbot TOM, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.
the hat took a long time to decide with  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
when it finally shou TED, " GRYFFINDOR,"  MR._LONGBOTTOM ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "macdougal, morag."
 MALFOY swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, " SLYTHERINS!"
 MALFOY went to join his friends  CRABBE and  GOYLE, looking pleased with himself.
there weren't many people left now.
"moon" "nott" "parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, " PATIL" and " PATIL" then "perks,  SALLY-ANNE" and then, at last -- " POTTER, harry!"
as harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
" POTTER, did she say?"
the  HARRY_POTTER?"
the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his e YEWs was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him.
next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat.
he wai TED.
hmm," said a small voice in his ear.
"difficult.
very difficult.
plenty of courage, i see.
not a bad mind either.
there's talent, a my goodness,  YEWs -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....
so where shall i put you?"
harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, not  SLYTHERINS, not  SLYTHERINS.
"not  SLYTHERINS, eh?"
said the small voice.
"are you sure?
you could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and  SLYTHERINS will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no?
well, if you're sure -- better be  GRYFFINDOR!"
harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall.
he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the  GRYFFINDOR table.
he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in  SLYTHERINS, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer  YEWt.
 PERCY_WEASLEY the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the weasley twins  YEWlled, "we got  POTTER!
we got  POTTER!"
harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier.
the ghost pat TED his arm, giving harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
he could see the high table properly now.
at the end nearest him sat hagrid, who caught his e YEW and gave him the thumbs up.
harry grinned back.
and there, in the center of the high table, in a large gold chair, sat  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train.
 DUmbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
harry spot TED professor  QUIRTELL, too, the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron.
he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
and now there were only three people left to be sor TED.
" THOMAS,  DEAN_THOMAS," a black boy even taller than ron, joined harry at the  GRYFFINDOR table.
" TURPIN,  LISA," became a  RAVENCLAW and then it was ron's turn.
he was pale green by now.
harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shou TED, " GRYFFINDOR!"
harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him.
"well  DONe, ron, excellent," said  PERCY_WEASLEY pompously across harry as "zabini,  BLAISE," was made a  SLYTHERINS.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away.
harry looked down at his empty gold plate.
he had only just realized how hungry he was.
the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
 ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE had gotten to his feet.
he was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
"welcome," he said.
"welcome to a new  YEWar at hogwarts!
before we begin our banquet, i would like to say a few words.
and here they are: nitwit!
blubber!
oddment!
tweak!
"thank you!"
he sat back down.
everybody clapped and cheered.
harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.
"is he -- a bit mad?"
he asked  PERCY_WEASLEY uncertainly.
"mad?"
said  PERCY_WEASLEY airily.
"he's a genius!
best wizard in the world!
but he is a bit mad,  YEWs.
potatoes, harry?"
harry's mouth fell open.
the dishes in front of him were now piled with food.
he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
the  DURSLEYS had never exactly starved harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.
 DUdley had always taken anything that harry really wan TED, even if it made him sick.
harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
it was all delicious.
"that does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching harry cut up his steak,
    "can't you --?"
i haven't eaten for nearly four hundred  YEWars," said the ghost.
"i  DON't need to, of course, but one does miss it.
i  DON't think i've in tro DUced myself?
sir  NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON at your service.
resident ghost of  GRYFFINDOR tower."
"i know who you are!"
said ron suddenly.
"my brothers told me about you -- you're nearly headless  NICK!"
"i would prefer you to call me sir  NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN interrup TED.
"nearly headless?
how can you be nearly headless?"
sir  NICHOLAS_DE_MIMSY-PORPINGTON looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wan TED.
"like this," he said irritably.
he seized his left ear and pulled.
his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not  DONe it properly.
looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, nearly headless  NICK flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "so -- new  GRYFFINDORs!
i hope you're going to help us win the house championship this  YEWar?
 GRYFFINDORs have never gone so long without winning.
 SLYTHERINS have got the cup six  YEWars in a row!
the bloody  BARON's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the  SLYTHERINS ghost."
harry looked over at the  SLYTHERINS table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring e YEWs, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.
he was right next to  MALFOY who, harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
"how did he get covered in blood?"
asked  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN with great interest.
"i've never asked," said nearly headless  NICK delicately.
when everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before.
a  MOMent later the desserts appeared.
blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jell-o, rice pudding -- "
    as harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
"i'm half-and-half," said  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN.
"me dad's a muggle.
 MOM didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married.
bit of a nasty shock for him."
the others laughed.
"what about you,  MR._LONGBOTTOM?"
said ron.
"well, my  GRAN brought me up and she's a witch," said  MR._LONGBOTTOM, "but the family thought i was all- muggle for ages.
my great uncle  ALGIE kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once, i nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until i was eight.
great uncle  ALGIE came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie  ENID offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go.
but i bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road.
they were all really pleased,  GRAN was crying, she was so happy.
and you should have seen their faces when i got in here -- they thought i might not be magic enough to come, you see.
great uncle  ALGIE was so pleased he bought me my toad."
on harry's other side,  PERCY_WEASLEY and  HERMLONE were talking about lessons ("i do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, i'm particularly interes TED in transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-"; "you'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- ").
harry, who was starting to feel warm and s LEE_JORDANpy, looked up at
    the high table again.
hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was talking to professor  DUmbledore.
professor  QUIRTELL, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
it happened very suddenly.
the hook-nosed teacher looked past  QUIRTELL's turban straight into harry's e YEWs -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on harry's forehead.
"ouch!"
harry clapped a hand to his head.
"what is it?"
asked  PERCY_WEASLEY.
"n-nothing."
the pain had gone as quickly as it had come.
harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like harry at all.
"who's that teacher talking to professor  QUIRTELL?"
he asked  PERCY_WEASLEY.
"oh, you know  QUIRTELL already, do you?
no wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor  SNAPE.
he teaches potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after  QUIRTELL's job.
knows an awful lot about the dark arts,  SNAPE."
harry watched  SNAPE for a while, but  SNAPE didn't look at him again.
at last, the desserts too disappeared, and professor  DUmbledore got to his feet again.
the hall fell silent.
" AHERN -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered.
i have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
"first  YEWars should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils.
and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well."
 DUmbledore's twinkling e YEWs flashed in the direction of the weasley twins.
"i have also been asked by mr.  FILCH, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
"quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
anyone interes TED in playing for their house teams should contact  MADAM_HOOCH.
"and finally, i must tell you that this  YEWar, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."
harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
"he's not serious?"
he muttered to  PERCY_WEASLEY.
"must be," said  PERCY_WEASLEY, frowning at  DUmbledore.
"it's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that.
i do think he might have told us prefects, at least."
"and now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"
cried  DUmbledore.
harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.
 DUmbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twis TED itself, snakelike, into words.
"everyone pick their favorite tune," said  DUmbledore, "and off we go!"
and the school  CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed:
    "hogwarts, hogwarts, hoggy warty hogwarts,
    teach us something please,
    whether we be old and bald
    or young with scabby knees,
    our heads could do with filling
    with some interesting stuff,
    for now they're bare and full of air,
    dead flies and bits of fluff,
    so teach us things worth knowing,
    bring back what we've forgot,
    just do your best, we'll do the rest,
    and learn until our brains all rot.
everybody finished the song at different times.
at last, only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
 DUmbledore con DUc TED their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
"ah, music," he said, wiping his e YEWs.
"a magic beyond all we do here!
and now, bedtime.
off you trot!"
the  GRYFFINDOR first  YEWars followed  PERCY_WEASLEY through the chattering crowds, out of the great hall, and up the marble staircase.
harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.
he was too s LEE_JORDANpy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and poin TED as they passed, or that twice  PERCY_WEASLEY led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries.
they climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.
a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as  PERCY_WEASLEY took a step toward them they star TED throwing themselves at him.
"peeves,"  PERCY_WEASLEY whispered to the first  YEWars.
"a poltergeist."
he raised his voice, "peeves -- show yourself"
    a loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
"do you want me to go to the bloody  BARON?"
there was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark e YEWs and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.
"oooooooh!"
he said, with an evil cackle.
"ickle firsties!
what fun!"
he swooped suddenly at them.
they all  DUcked.
"go away, peeves, or the  BARON'll hear about this, i mean it!"
barked  PERCY_WEASLEY.
peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on  MR._LONGBOTTOM's head.
they heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.
"you want to watch out for peeves," said  PERCY_WEASLEY, as they set off again.
"the bloody  BARON's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects.
here we are."
at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.
"password?"
she said.
"caput draconis," said  PERCY_WEASLEY, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.
they all scrambled through it --  MR._LONGBOTTOM needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the  GRYFFINDOR common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
 PERCY_WEASLEY direc TED the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another.
at the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains.
their trunks had already been brought up.
too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.
    "
great food, isn't it?"
ron muttered to harry through the hangings.
"get off,  SCABBERS!
he's chewing my sheets."
harry was going to ask ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell as LEE_JORDANp almost at once.
perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream.
he was wearing professor  QUIRTELL's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to  SLYTHERINS at once, because it was his destiny.
harry told the turban he didn't want to be in  SLYTHERINS; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was  MALFOY, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then  MALFOY turned into the hook-nosed teacher,  SNAPE, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and harry woke, sweating and shaking.
he rolled over and fell as LEE_JORDANp again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.
chapter eight.
the potions master.
there, look."
"where?"
"next to the tall kid with the red hair."
"wearing the glasses?"
"did you see his face?"
"did you see his scar?"
whispers followed harry from the  MOMent he left his dormitory the next day.
people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
there were a hundred and forty-two staircases at hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.
then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.
it was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.
the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
the ghosts didn't help, either.
it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.
nearly headless  NICK was always happy to point new  GRYFFINDORs in the right direction, but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class.
he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, "got your conk!"
even worse than peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, argus  FILCH.
harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.
 FILCH found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.
he wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the  DUngeons when they were rescued by professor  QUIRTELL, who was passing.
 FILCH owned a cat called mrs.  NORRIS, a scrawny,  DUst-colored creature with bulging, lamp like e YEWs just like  FILCH's.
she patrolled the corridors alone.
break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for  FILCH, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later.
 FILCH knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts.
the students all ha TED him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs.  NORRIS a good kick.
and then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves.
there was a lot more to magic, as harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.
three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology, with a  DUmpy little witch called professor sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
easily the most boring class was history of magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.
professor  BINNS had been very old
    indeed when he had fallen as LEE_JORDANp in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.
 BINNS droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed up.
professor  FLITWICK, the charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.
at the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached harry's name he gave an exci TED squeak and toppled out of sight.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was again different.
harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross.
strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the  MOMent they sat down in her first class.
"transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts," she said.
"anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
you have been warned."
then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.
they were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get star TED, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
after taking a lot of complica TED notes, they were each given a match and star TED trying to turn it into a needle.
by the end of the lesson, only  HERMIONE_GRANGER had made any difference to her match; professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave  HERMLONE a rare smile.
the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts, but  QUIRTELL's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.
his classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.
his turban, he told them, had been given to him by an african prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.
for one thing, when  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN asked eagerly to hear how  QUIRTELL had fought off the zombie,  QUIRTELL went pink and star TED talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the weasley twins insis TED that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that  QUIRTELL was protec TED wherever he went.
harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else.
lots of people had come from muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards.
there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn't have much of a head start.
friday was an important day for harry and ron.
they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
"what have we got today?"
harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.
"double potions with the  SLYTHERINS," said ron.
" SNAPE's head of  SLYTHERINS house.
they say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true."
"wish  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL favored us, " said harry.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was head of  GRYFFINDOR house, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
just then, the mail arrived.
harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall  DUring breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.
 HEDWIG hadn't brought harry anything so far.
she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to s LEE_JORDANp in the owlery with the other school owls.
this morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harry's plate.
harry tore it open at once.
it said, in a very untidy scrawl:
    dear harry,
    i know you get friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
i want to hear all about your first week.
send us an answer back with  HEDWIG.
hagrid
    harry borrowed ron's quill, scribbled  YEWs, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent  HEDWIG off again.
it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to, because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.
at the start-of-term banquet, harry had gotten the idea that professor  SNAPE disliked him.
by the end of the first potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong.
 SNAPE didn't dislike harry -- he ha TED him.
potions lessons took place down in one of the  DUngeons.
it was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
 SNAPE, like  FLITWICK, star TED the class by taking the roll call, and like  FLITWICK, he paused at harry's name.
"ah,  YEWs," he said softly, " HARRY_POTTER.
our new -- celebrity."
draco  MALFOY and his friends  CRABBE and  GOYLE sniggered behind their hands.
 SNAPE finished calling the names and looked up at the class.
his e YEWs were black like hagrid's, but they had none of hagrid's warmth.
they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
"you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking," he began.
he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL,  SNAPE had y caught every word -- like professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL,  SNAPE had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.
"as there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic.
i  DON't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses....
i can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of  DUnderheads as i usually have to teach."
more silence followed this little speech.
harry and ron exchanged looks with raised e YEWbrows.
 HERMIONE_GRANGER was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a  DUnderhead.
" POTTER!"
said  SNAPE suddenly.
"what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of worm WOOD?"
powdered root of what to an infusion of what?
harry glanced at ron, who looked as stumped as he was;  HERMLONE's hand had shot into the air.
"i  DON't know, sit," said harry.
 SNAPE's lips curled into a sneer.
"tut, tut -- fame clearly isn't everything."
he ignored  HERMLONE's hand.
"let's try again.
 POTTER, where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar?"
 HERMLONE stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.
he tried not to look at  MALFOY,  CRABBE, and  GOYLE, who were shaking with laughter.
"i  DON't know, sit."
"thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh,  POTTER?"
harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold e YEWs.
he had looked through his books at the  DURSLEYS', but did  SNAPE expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi?
 SNAPE was still ignoring  HERMLONE's quivering hand.
"what is the difference,  POTTER, between monkshood and wolfs BANE?"
at this,  HERMLONE stood up, her hand stretching toward the  DUngeon ceiling.
"i  DON't know," said harry quietly.
"i think  HERMLONE does, though, why  DON't you try her?"
a few people laughed; harry caught  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's e YEW, and  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN winked.
 SNAPE, however, was not pleased.
"sit down," he snapped at  HERMLONE.
"for your information,  POTTER, asphodel and worm WOOD make a s LEE_JORDANping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death.
a bezoar is a stone taken from the s TOMach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
as for monkshood and wolfs BANE, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.
well?
why aren't you all copying that down?"
there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment.
over the noise,  SNAPE said, "and a point will be taken from  GRYFFINDOR house for your cheek,  POTTER."
things didn't improve for the  GRYFFINDORs as the potions lesson continued.
 SNAPE put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.
he swept around in his long black cl OAK, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake  FANGs, criticizing almost everyone except  MALFOY, whom he seemed to like.
he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way  MALFOY had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the  DUngeon.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM had somehow managed to melt  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN's cauldron into a twis TED blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes.
within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while  MR._LONGBOTTOM, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
"idiot boy!"
snarled  SNAPE, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand.
"i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"
 MR._LONGBOTTOM whimpered as boils star TED to pop up all over his nose.
"take him up to the hospital wing,"  SNAPE spat at  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN.
then he rounded on harry and ron, who had been working next to  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"you --  POTTER -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills?
thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?
that's another point you've lost for  GRYFFINDOR."
this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue, but ron kicked him behind their cauldron.
"doi* push it," he muttered, "i've heard  SNAPE can turn very nasty."
as they climbed the steps out of the  DUngeon an hour later, harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low.
he'd lost two points for  GRYFFINDOR in his very first week -- why did  SNAPE hate him so much?
"cheer up," said ron, " SNAPE's always taking points off  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY.
can i come and meet hagrid with you?"
at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds.
hagrid lived in a small  WOODen house on the edge of the forbidden forest.
a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.
when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.
then hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "back,  FANG -- back."
hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.
"hang on," he said.
"back,  FANG."
he let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
there was only one room inside.
hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
"make  YEWrselves at home," said hagrid, letting go of  FANG, who bounded straight at ron and star TED licking his ears.
like hagrid,  FANG was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
"this is ron," harry told hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
"another weasley, eh?"
said hagrid, glancing at ron's freckles.
i spent half me life  CHASIN'  YEWr twin brothers away from the forest."
the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first -lessons.
 FANG res TED his head on harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.
harry and ron were deligh TED to hear hagrid call  FITCH "that old git."
"an' as for that cat, mrs.  NORRIS, i'd like ter intro DUce her to  FANG sometime.
d' YEWh know, every time i go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere?
can't get rid of her --  FITCH puts her up to it."
harry told hagrid about  SNAPE's lesson.
hagrid, like ron, told harry not to worry about it, that  SNAPE liked hardly any of the students.
"but he seemed to really hate me."
"rubbish!"
said hagrid.
"why should he?"
 YEWt harry couldn't help thinking that hagrid didn't quite meet his e YEWs when he said that.
"how's  YEWr brother charlie?"
hagrid asked ron.
"i liked him a lot -- great with animals."
harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
while ron told hagrid all about charlie's work with dragons, harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy.
it was a cutting from the daily  PROPHET:
     GRINGOTTS break-in latest
    investigations continue into the break-in at  GRINGOTTS on 31 july, widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown.
 GRINGOTTS goblins today insis TED that nothing had been taken.
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
"but we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you," said a  GRINGOTTS spokesgoblin this afternoon.
harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob  GRINGOTTS, but ron hadn't mentioned the date.
"hagrid!"
said harry, "that  GRINGOTTS break-in happened on my birthday!
it might've been happening while we were there!"
there was no doubt about it, hagrid definitely didn't meet harry's e YEWs this time.
he grun TED and offered him another rock cake.
harry read the story again.
the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.
hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.
had that been what the thieves were looking for?
as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid.
had hagrid collec TED that package just in time?
where was it now?
and did hagrid know something about  SNAPE that he didn't want to tell harry?
chapter nine.
the midnight  DUel.
harry had never believed he would meet a boy he ha TED more than  DUdley, but that was before he met draco  MALFOY.
still, first- YEWar  GRYFFINDORs only had potions with the  SLYTHERINS, so they didn't have to put up with  MALFOY much.
or at least, they didn't until they spot TED a notice pinned up in the  GRYFFINDOR common room that made them all groan.
flying lessons would be starting on thursday -- and  GRYFFINDOR and  SLYTHERINS would be learning together.
"typical," said harry darkly.
"just what i always wan TED.
to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of  MALFOY."
he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
"you  DON't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said ron reasonably.
"anyway, i know  MALFOY's always going on about how good he is at quidditch, but i bet that's all talk."
 MALFOY certainly did talk about flying a lot.
he complained loudly about first  YEWars never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters.
he wasn't the only one, though: the way  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.
even ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on charlie's old broom.
everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly.
ron had already had a big argument with  DEAN_THOMAS  THOMAS, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.
ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.
harry had caught ron prodding  DEAN_THOMAS's poster of west ham soccer team, trying to make the pla YEWrs move.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his  GRANd MOTHER had never let him near one.
privately, harry felt she'd had good reason, because  MR._LONGBOTTOM managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
 HERMIONE_GRANGER was almost as nervous about flying as  MR._LONGBOTTOM was.
this was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried.
at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when  HERMLONE's lecture was interrup TED by the arrival of the mail.
harry hadn't had a single letter since hagrid's note, something that  MALFOY had been quick to notice, of course.
 MALFOY's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the  SLYTHERINS table.
a barn owl brought  MR._LONGBOTTOM a small package from his  GRANd MOTHER.
he opened it exci TEDly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
"it's a  REMEMBRALL!"
he explained.
" GRAN knows i forget things -- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.
look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." his face fell, because the  REMEMBRALL had suddenly glowed scarlet,
    "you've forgotten something..."
     MR._LONGBOTTOM was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when draco  MALFOY, who was passing the  GRYFFINDOR table, snatched the  REMEMBRALL out of his hand.
harry and ron jumped to their feet.
they were half hoping for a reason to fight  MALFOY, but professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
"what's going on?"
" MALFOY's got my  REMEMBRALL, professor."
scowling,  MALFOY quickly dropped the  REMEMBRALL back on the table.
"just looking," he said, and he sloped away with  CRABBE and  GOYLE behind him.
at three-thirty that afternoon, harry, ron, and the other  GRYFFINDORs hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.
it was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.
the  SLYTHERINS were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.
harry had heard  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them star TED to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
their teacher,  MADAM_HOOCH, arrived.
she had short, gray hair, and  YEWllow e YEWs like a hawk.
"well, what are you all waiting for?"
she barked.
"everyone stand by a broomstick.
come on, hurry up."
harry glanced down at his broom.
it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.
"stick out your right hand over your broom," called  MADAM_HOOCH at the front, "and say 'up!"'
"upf everyone shou TED.
harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.
 HERMIONE_GRANGER's had simply rolled over on the ground, and  MR._LONGBOTTOM's hadn't moved at all.
perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought harry; there was a quaver in  MR._LONGBOTTOM's voice that said only too clearly that he wan TED to keep his feet on the ground.
 MADAM_HOOCH then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
harry and ron were deligh TED when she told  MALFOY he'd been doing it wrong for  YEWars.
"now, when i blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said  MADAM_HOOCH.
"keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.
on my whistle -- three -- two --"
    but  MR._LONGBOTTOM, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched  MADAM_HOOCH's lips.
"come back, boy!"
she shou TED, but  MR._LONGBOTTOM was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet.
harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --
    wham -- a thud and a nasty crack and  MR._LONGBOTTOM lay facedown on the grass in a heap.
his broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and star TED to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
 MADAM_HOOCH was bending over  MR._LONGBOTTOM, her face as white as his.
"broken wrist," harry heard her mutter.
"come on, boy -- it's all right, up you get.".
she turned to the rest of the class.
"none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing!
you leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of hogwarts before you can say 'quidditch.'
come on, dear."
 MR._LONGBOTTOM, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with  MADAM_HOOCH, who had her arm around him.
no sooner were they out of earshot than  MALFOY burst into laughter.
"did you see his face, the great lump?"
the other  SLYTHERINS joined in.
"shut up,  MALFOY," snapped parvati  PATIL.
"ooh, sticking up for longbot TOM?"
said  PANSY_PARKINSON, a hard-faced  SLYTHERINS girl.
"never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, parvati."
"look!"
said  MALFOY, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.
"it's that stupid thing longbot TOM's  GRAN sent him."
the  REMEMBRALL glittered in the sun as he held it up.
"give that here,  MALFOY," said harry quietly.
everyone stopped talking to watch.
 MALFOY smiled nastily.
"i think i'll leave it somewhere for longbot TOM to find -- how about -- up a tree?"
"give it here!"
harry  YEWlled, but  MALFOY had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.
he hadn't been lying, he could fly well.
hovering level with the topmost branches of an  OAK he called, "come and get it,  POTTER!"
harry grabbed his broom.
"no!"
shou TED  HERMIONE_GRANGER.
" MADAM_HOOCH told us not to move -- you'll get us all into trouble."
harry ignored her.
blood was pounding in his ears.
he moun TED the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful.
he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron.
he turned his broomstick sharply to face  MALFOY in midair.
 MALFOY looked stunned.
"give it here," harry called, "or i'll knock you off that broom!"
"oh,  YEWah?"
said  MALFOY, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
harry knew, somehow, what to do.
he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward  MALFOY like a javelin.
 MALFOY only just got out of the way in time; harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady.
a few people below were clapping.
"no  CRABBE and  GOYLE up here to save your neck,  MALFOY," harry called.
the same thought seemed to have struck  MALFOY.
"catch it if you can, then!"
he shou TED, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.
he leaned forward and poin TED his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the  REMEMBRALL clutched safely in his fist.
" HARRY_POTTER!"
his heart sank faster than he'd just dived.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was running toward them.
he got to his feet, trembling.
"never -- in all my time at hogwarts --"
    professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"
    "it wasn't his fault, professor --"
    "be quiet, miss  PATIL
    "but  MALFOY --"
    "that's enough, mr. weasley.
 POTTER, follow me, now."
harry caught sight of  MALFOY,  CRABBE, and  GOYLE's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's wake as she strode toward the castle.
he was going to be expelled, he just knew it.
he wan TED to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up.
now he'd  DONe it.
he hadn't even las TED two weeks.
he'd be packing his bags in ten minutes.
what would the  DURSLEYS say when he turned up on the doorstep?
up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL didn't say a word to him.
she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her.
maybe she was taking him to  DUmbledore.
he thought of hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.
perhaps he could be hagrid's assistant.
his s TOMach twis TED as he imagined it, watching ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrid's bag.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL stopped outside a classroom.
she opened the door and poked her head inside.
"excuse me, professor  FLITWICK, could i borrow  WOOD for a  MOMent?"
 WOOD?
thought harry, bewildered; was  WOOD a cane she was going to use on him?
but  WOOD turned out to be a person, a burly fifth- YEWar boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confused.
"follow me, you two," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, and they marched on up the corridor,  WOOD looking curiously at harry.
"in here."
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL poin TED them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
"out, peeves!"
she barked.
peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.
" POTTER, this is  OLIVER_WOOD.
 WOOD -- i've found you a seeker."
 WOOD's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
"are you serious, professor?"
"absolutely," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL crisply.
"the boy's a natural.
i've never seen anything like it.
was that your first time on a broomstick,  POTTER?"
harry nodded silently.
he didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling star TED coming back to his legs.
"he caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL told  WOOD.
"didn't even scratch himself.
 MRS._CHARLIE couldn't have  DONe it."
 WOOD was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
"ever seen a game of quidditch,  POTTER?"
he asked exci TEDly.
" WOOD's captain of the  GRYFFINDOR team," professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL explained.
"he's just the build for a seeker, too," said  WOOD, now walking around harry and staring at him.
"light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a decent broom, professor -- a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven, i'd say."
i shall speak to professor  DUmbledore and see if we can't bend the first- YEWar rule.
heaven knows, we need a better team than last  YEWar.
flattened in that last match by  SLYTHERINS, i couldn't look  SEVERUS_SNAPE in the face for weeks...."
    professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL peered sternly over her glasses at harry.
"i want to hear you're training hard,  POTTER, or i may change my mind about punishing you."
then she suddenly smiled.
"your father would have been proud," she said.
"he was an excellent quidditch pla YEWr himself."
"you're joking."
it was dinnertime.
harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.
"seeker?"
he said.
"but first  YEWars never -- you must be the youngest house pla YEWr in about a century, said harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.
he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon.
" WOOD told me."
ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at harry.
"i start training next week," said harry.
"only  DON't tell anyone,  WOOD wants to keep it a secret."
 FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY now came into the hall, spot TED harry, and hurried over.
"well  DONe," said  GEORGE_WEASLEY in a low voice.
" WOOD told us.
we're on the team too -- beaters."
"i tell you, we're going to win that quidditch cup for sure this  YEWar," said  FRED_WEASLEY.
"we haven't won since charlie left, but this  YEWar's team is going to be brilliant.
you must be good, harry,  WOOD was almost skipping when he told us."
"anyway, we've got to go,  LEE_JORDAN reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school."
"bet it's that one behind the statue of  GREGORY_THE_SMARMY that we found in our first week.
see you."
 FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up:  MALFOY, flanked by  CRABBE and  GOYLE.
"having a last meal,  POTTER?
when are you getting the train back to the muggles?"
"you're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," said harry coolly.
there was of course nothing at all little about  CRABBE and  GOYLE, but as the high table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.
"i'd take you on anytime on my own," said  MALFOY.
"tonight, if you want.
wizard's  DUel.
wands only -- no contact.
what's the matter?
never heard of a wizard's  DUel before, i suppose?"
"of course he has," said ron, wheeling around.
"i'm his second, who's yours?"
 MALFOY looked at  CRABBE and  GOYLE, sizing them up.
" CRABBE," he said.
"midnight all right?
we'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked."
when  MALFOY had gone, ron and harry looked at each other.
"what is a wizard's  DUel?"
said harry.
"and what do you mean, you're my second?"
"well, a second's there to take over if you die," said ron casually, getting star TED at last on his cold pie.
catching the look on harry's face, he added quickly, "but people only die in proper  DUels, you know, with real wizards.
the most you and  MALFOY'll be able to do is send sparks at each other.
neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage.
i bet he expec TED you to refuse, anyway."
"and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens?"
"throw it away and punch him on the nose," ron sugges TED.
"excuse me."
they both looked up.
it was  HERMIONE_GRANGER.
"can't a person eat in peace in this place?"
said ron.
 HERMLONE ignored him and spoke to harry.
"i couldn't help overhearing what you and  MALFOY were saying --"
    "bet you could," ron muttered.
    "
--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose  GRYFFINDOR if you're caught, and you're bound to be.
it's really very selfish of you."
"and it's really none of your business," said harry.
"good-b YEW," said ron.
all the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to  DEAN_THOMAS and  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN falling as LEE_JORDANp ( MR._LONGBOTTOM wasn't back from the hospital wing).
ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as "if he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because i can't remember how to block them."
there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by  FILCH or mrs.  NORRIS, and harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today.
on the other hand,  MALFOYs sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat  MALFOY face-to-face.
he couldn't miss it.
"half-past eleven," ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
they pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the  GRYFFINDOR common room.
a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.
they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "i can't believe you're going to do this, harry."
a lamp flickered on.
it was  HERMIONE_GRANGER, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.
"you!"
said ron furiously.
"go back to bed!"
"i almost told your brother,"  HERMLONE snapped, " PERCY_WEASLEY -- he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this."
harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
"come on," he said to ron.
he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole.
 HERMLONE wasn't going to give up that easily.
she followed ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
" DON't you care about  GRYFFINDOR, do you only care about yourselves, i  DON't want  SLYTHERINS to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points i got from professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL for knowing about switching spells."
"go away."
"all right, but i warned you, you just remember what i said when you're on the train home  TOMorrow, you're so --"
    but what they were, they didn't find out.
 HERMLONE had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.
the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and  HERMLONE was locked out of  GRYFFINDOR tower.
"now what am i going to do?"
she asked shrilly.
"that's your problem," said ron.
"we've got to go, we 3 re going to be late."
they hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when  HERMLONE caught up with them.
"i'm coming with you," she said.
"you are not."
"d'you think i'm going to stand out here and wait for  FILCH to catch me?
if he finds all three of us i'll tell him the truth, that i was trying to stop you, and you can back me up."
"you've got some nerve --" said ron loudly.
"shut up, both of you!"
said harry sharply.
i heard something."
it was a sort of snuffling.
"mrs.
 NORRIS?"
breathed ron, squinting through the dark.
it wasn't mrs.  NORRIS.
it was  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
he was curled up on the floor, fast as LEE_JORDANp, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
"thank goodness you found me!
i've been out here for hours, i couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed."
"keep your voice down,  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
the password's 'pig snout' but it won't help you now, the fat lady's gone off somewhere."
"how's your arm?"
said harry.
"fine," said  MR._LONGBOTTOM, showing them.
" MADAM_POMFTEY mended it in about a minute."
"good - well, look,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later --"
    " DON't leave me!"
said  MR._LONGBOTTOM, scrambling to his feet, "i  DON't want to stay here alone, the bloody  BARON's been past twice already."
ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at  HERMLONE and  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"if either of you get us caught, i'll never rest until i've learned that curse of the bogies  QUIRTELL told us about, and used it on you.
 HERMLONE opened her mouth, perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies, but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
they flit TED along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows.
at every turn harry expec TED to run into  FILCH or mrs.  NORRIS, but they were lucky.
they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
 MALFOY and  CRABBE weren't there  YEWt.
the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them.
cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness.
they edged along the walls, keeping their e YEWs on the doors at either end of the room.
harry took out his wand in case  MALFOY leapt in and star TED at once.
the minutes crept by.
"he's late, maybe he's chickened out," ron whispered.
then a noise in the next room made them jump.
harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't  MALFOY.
"sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
it was  FILCH speaking to mrs.  NORRIS.
horror-struck, harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from  FILCH's voice.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard  FILCH enter the trophy room.
"they're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding."
"this way!"
harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.
they could hear  FILCH getting nearer.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.
the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
"run!"
harry  YEWlled, and the four of them sprin TED down the gallery, not looking back to see whether  FILCH was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
"i think we've lost him," harry pan TED, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.
i -- told -you,"  HERMLONE gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "i -- told -- you."
"we've got to get back to  GRYFFINDOR tower," said ron, "quickly as possible."
" MALFOY tricked you,"  HERMLONE said to harry.
"you realize that,  DON't you?
he was never going to meet you --  FILCH knew someone was going to be in the trophy room,  MALFOY must have tipped him off."
harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.
"let's go."
it wasn't going to be that simple.
they hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.
it was peeves.
he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
"shut up, peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
peeves cackled.
"wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties?
tut, tut, tut.
naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty."
"not if you  DON't give us away, peeves, please."
"should tell  FILCH, i should," said peeves in a saintly voice, but his e YEWs glittered wickedly.
"it's for your own good, you know."
"get out of the way," snapped ron, taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake.
"students out of bed!"
peeves  CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed, "students out of bed down the charms corridor"
     DUcking under peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.
"this is it!"
ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "we're  DONe for!
this is the end!"
they could hear footsteps,  FILCH running as fast as he could toward peeves's shouts.
"oh, move over,"  HERMLONE snarled.
she grabbed harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'alohomora!"
the lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
"which way did they go, peeves?"
 FILCH was saying.
"quick, tell me."
"say 'please."'
" DON't mess with me, peeves, now where did they go?"
"shan't say nothing if you  DON't say please," said peeves in his annoying singsong voice.
"all right -please."
"nothing!
ha haaa!
told you i wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please!
ha ha!
haaaaaa!"
and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and  FILCH cursing in rage.
"he thinks this door is locked," harry whispered.
"i think we'll be okay -- get off,  MR._LONGBOTTOM!"
for  MR._LONGBOTTOM had been tugging on the s LEE_JORDANve of harry's bathrobe for the last minute.
"what?"
harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what.
for a  MOMent, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
they weren't in a room, as he had supposed.
they were in a corridor.
the forbidden corridor on the third floor.
and now they knew why it was forbidden.
they were looking straight into the e YEWs of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.
it had three heads.
three pairs of rolling, mad e YEWs; three noses, twitching
    and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from  YEWllowish  FANGs.
it was standing quite still, all six e YEWs staring at them, and harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
harry groped for the doorknob -- between  FILCH and death, he'd take  FILCH.
they fell backward -- harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor.
 FILCH must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wan TED to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster.
they didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor.
"where on earth have you all been?"
she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," pan TED harry, and the portrait swung forward.
they scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
it was a while before any of them said anything.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.
"what do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"
said ron finally.
"if any dog needs exercise, that one does."
 HERMLONE had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
"you  DON't use your e YEWs, any of you, do you?"
she snapped.
"didn't you see what it was standing on.
"the floor?"
harry sugges TED.
"i wasn't looking at its feet, i was too busy with its heads."
"no, not the floor.
it was standing on a trapdoor.
it's obviously guarding something."
she stood up, glaring at them.
i hope you're pleased with yourselves.
we could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.
now, if you  DON't mind, i'm going to bed."
ron stared after her, his mouth open.
"no, we  DON't mind," he said.
"you'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you.
but  HERMLONE had  GIVEN_HARRY something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.
the dog was guarding something.... what had hagrid said?
 GRINGOTTS was the safest place in the world for something you wan TED to hide -- except perhaps hogwarts.
it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
chapter ten.
halloween.
 MALFOY couldn't believe his e YEWs when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
indeed, by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.
in the meantime, harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from  GRINGOTTS to hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
"it's either really valuable or really dangerous," said ron.
"or both," said harry.
but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.
neither  MR._LONGBOTTOM nor  HERMLONE showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.
all  MR._LONGBOTTOM cared about was never going near the dog again.
 HERMLONE was now refusing to speak to harry and ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
all they really wan TED now was a way of getting back at  MALFOY, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.
harry was just as interes TED as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor.
they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.
harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:
    do not open the parcel at the table.
it contains your new nimbus two thousand, but i  DON't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one.
 OLIVER_WOOD will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL
    harry had difficulty hiding his g LEE_JORDAN as he handed the note to ron to read.
"a nimbus two thousand!"
ron moaned enviously.
"i've never even touched one."
they left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by  CRABBE and  GOYLE.
 MALFOY seized the package from harry and felt it.
"that's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.
"you'll be in for it this time,  POTTER, first  YEWars aren't allowed them."
ron couldn't resist it.
"it's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a nimbus two thousand.
what did you say you've got at home,  MALFOY, a comet two sixty?"
ron grinned at harry.
"comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the nimbus."
"what would you know about it, weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,"  MALFOY snapped back.
"i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig."
before ron could answer, professor  FLITWICK appeared at  MALFOY's elbow.
"not arguing, i hope, boys?"
he squeaked.
" POTTER's been sent a broomstick, professor," said  MALFOY quickly.
" YEWs,  YEWs, that's right," said professor  FLITWICK, beaming at harry.
"professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL told me all about the special circumstances,  POTTER.
and what model is it?"
"a nimbus two thousand, sit," said harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on  MALFOY's face.
"and it's really thanks to  MALFOY here that i've got it," he added.
harry and ron headed upstairs, s MOTHERing their laughter at  MALFOY's obvious rage and confusion.
"well, it's true," harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "if he hadn't stolen  MR._LONGBOTTOM's  REMEMBRALL i wouln't be on the team...."
    "so i suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?"
came an angry voice from just behind them.
 HERMLONE was s TOMping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in harry's hand.
"i thought you weren't speaking to us?"
said harry.
" YEWs,  DON't stop now," said ron, "it's doing us so much good."
 HERMLONE marched away with her nose in the air.
harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.
it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night.
he bol TED his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last.
"wow," ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto harry's bedspread.
even harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.
s LEE_JORDANk and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top.
as seven o'clock drew nearer, harry left the castle and set off in the  DUsk toward the quidditch field.
held never been inside the stadium before.
hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.
at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.
they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle
    children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
too eager to fly again to wait for  WOOD, harry moun TED his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.
what a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.
the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wan TED at his lightest touch.
"hey,  POTTER, come down!'
 OLIVER_WOOD had arrived.
fie was carrying a large  WOODen crate under his arm.
harry landed next to him.
"very nice," said  WOOD, his e YEWs glinting.
"i see what  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL meant... you really are a natural.
i'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
he opened the crate.
inside were four different-sized balls.
"right," said  WOOD.
"now, quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play.
there are seven pla YEWrs on each side.
three of them are called chasers."
"three chasers," harry repea TED, as  WOOD took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.
"this ball's called the quaffle," said  WOOD.
"the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.
ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops.
follow me?"
"the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," harry reci TED.
"so -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?"
"what's basketball?"
said  WOOD curiously.
"never mind," said harry quickly.
"now, there's another pla YEWr on each side who's called the keeper -i'm keeper for  GRYFFINDOR.
i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring."
"three chasers, one keeper," said harry, who was determined to remember it all.
"and they play with the quaffle.
okay, got that.
so what are they for?"
he poin TED at the three balls left inside the box.
"i'll show you now," said  WOOD.
"take this."
he handed harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
"i'm going to show you what the bludgers do,"  WOOD said.
"these two are the bludgers."
he showed harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle.
harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.
"stand back,"  WOOD warned harry.
he bent down and freed one of the bludgers.
at once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pel TED straight at harry's face.
harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at  WOOD, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
"see?"
 WOOD pan TED, forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely.
"the bludgers rocket around, trying to knock pla YEWrs off their brooms.
that's why you have two beaters on each team -- the weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team.
so -- think you've got all that?"
"three chasers try and score with the quaffle; the keeper guards the goal posts; the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team," harry reeled off.
"very good," said  WOOD.
"er -- have the bludgers ever killed anyone?"
harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.
"never at hogwarts.
we've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that.
now, the last member of the team is the
    seeker.
that's you.
and you  DON't have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open."
" DON't worry, the  MRS._WEASLEY are more than a match for the bludgers -- i mean, they're like a pair of human bludgers themselves."
 WOOD reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
compared with the quaffle and the bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.
it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.
"this," said  WOOD, "is the  GOLDEN_SNITCH, and it's the most important ball of the lot.
it's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see.
it's the seeker's job to catch it.
you've got to weave in and out of the chasers, beaters, bludgers, and quaffle to get it before the other team's seeker, because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they
    nearly always win.
that's why seekers get fouled so much.
a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- i think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the pla YEWrs could get some s LEE_JORDANp.
"well, that's it -- any questions?"
harry shook his head.
he understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.
"we won't practice with the snitch  YEWt," said  WOOD, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it.
let's try you out with a few of these."
he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and harry were up in the air,  WOOD throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch.
harry didn't miss a single one, and  WOOD was deligh TED.
after half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.
"that quidditch cup'll have our name on it this  YEWar," said  WOOD happily as they trudged back up to the castle.
"i wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than  MRS._CHARLIE, and he could have pla YEWd for england if he hadn't gone off  CHASINg dragons."
perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at hogwarts two months.
the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had.
his lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.
on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.
even better, professor  FLITWICK announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make  MR._LONGBOTTOM's toad zoom around the classroom.
professor  FLITWICK put the class into pairs to practice.
harry's partner was  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN (which was a relief, because  MR._LONGBOTTOM had been trying to catch his e YEW).
ron, however, was to be working with  HERMIONE_GRANGER.
it was hard to tell whether ron or  HERMLONE was angrier about this.
she hadn't spoken to either of them since the day harry's broomstick had arrived.
"now,  DON't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
squeaked professor  FLITWICK, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.
"swish and flick, remember, swish and flick.
and saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget  WIZARD_BARUFFIO, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest."
it was very difficult.
harry and  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.
 SEAMUS_FINNIGAN got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- harry had to put it out with his hat.
ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
"wingardium leviosa!"
he shou TED, waving his long arms like a windmill.
"you're saying it wrong," harry heard  HERMLONE snap.
"it's wing-gar-dium levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."
"you do it, then, if you're so clever," ron snarled.
 HERMLONE rolled up the s LEE_JORDANves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "wingardium leviosa!"
their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.
"oh, well  DONe!"
cried professor  FLITWICK, clapping.
"everyone see here, miss  GRANger's  DONe it!"
ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.
"it's no wonder no one can stand her," he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "
someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him.
it was  HERMLONE.
harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.
"i think she heard you."
"so?"
said ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.
"she must've noticed she's got no friends."
 HERMLONE didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.
on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast, harry and ron overheard parvati  PATIL telling her friend lavender that  HERMLONE was crying in the girls' bathroom and wan TED to be left alone.
ron looked still more awkward at this, but a  MOMent later they had entered the great hall, where the halloween decorations put  HERMLONE out of their minds.
a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.
the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor  QUIRTELL came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
everyone stared as he reached professor  DUmbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, "troll -- in the  DUngeons -- thought you ought to know."
he then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
there was an uproar.
it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor  DUmbledore's wand to bring silence.
"prefects," he rumbled, "lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately!"
 PERCY_WEASLEY was in his element.
"follow me!
stick together, first  YEWars!
no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders!
stay close behind me, now.
make way, first  YEWars coming through!
excuse me, i'm a prefect!"
"how could a troll get in?"
harry asked as they climbed the stairs.
" DON't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said ron.
"maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke."
they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused  HUFFLEPUFFS, harry suddenly grabbed ron's arm.
"i've just thought --  HERMLONE."
"what about her?"
"she doesn't know about the troll."
ron bit his lip.
"oh, all right," he snapped.
"but  PERCY_WEASLEY'd better not see us."
 DUcking down, they joined the  HUFFLEPUFFS going the other way, slipped down a deser TED side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom.
they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.
" PERCY_WEASLEY!"
hissed ron, pulling harry behind a large stone griffin.
peering around it, however, they saw not  PERCY_WEASLEY but  SNAPE.
he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.
"what's he doing?"
harry whispered.
"why isn't he down in the  DUngeons with the rest of the teachers?"
"search me."
quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after  SNAPE's fading footsteps.
"he's heading for the third floor," harry said, but ron held up his hand.
"can you smell something?"
harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
and then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.
ron poin TED -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them.
they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
it was a horrible sight.
twelve feet tall, its skin was a  DUll,  GRANite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut.
it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.
the smell coming from it was incredible.
it was holding a huge  WOODen club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.
the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.
it waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
"the keys in the lock," harry muttered.
"we could lock it in."
"good idea," said ron nervously.
they edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it.
with one great leap, harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.
' YEWs!"
flushed with their victory, they star TED to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.
"oh, no," said ron, pale as the bloody  BARON.
"it's the girls' bathroom!"
harry gasped.
" HERMLONE!"
they said together.
it was the last thing they wan TED to do, but what choice did they have?
wheeling around, they sprin TED back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic.
harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.
 HERMIONE_GRANGER was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.
the troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.
"confuse it!"
harry said desperately to ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
the troll stopped a few feet from  HERMLONE.
it lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.
its mean little e YEWs saw harry.
it hesita TED, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.
"oy, pea-brain!"
 YEWlled ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it.
the troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the  YEWll and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward ron instead, giving harry time to run around it.
"come on, run, run!"
harry  YEWlled at  HERMLONE, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.
the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.
it roared again and star TED toward ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.
harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind.
the troll couldn't feel harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of  WOOD up its nose, and harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
howling with pain, the troll twis TED and flailed its club, with harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.
 HERMLONE had sunk to the floor in fright; ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "wingardium leviosa!"
the club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.
the troll swa YEWd on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
harry got to his feet.
he was shaking and out of breath.
ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had  DONe.
it was  HERMLONE who spoke first.
"is it -- dead?"
i  DON't think so," said harry, i think it's just been knocked out."
he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose.
it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
"urgh -- troll boogers."
he wiped it on the troll's trousers.
a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.
they hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars.
a  MOMent later, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had come bursting into the room, closely followed by  SNAPE, with  QUIRTELL bringing up the rear.
 QUIRTELL took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
 SNAPE bent over the troll.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was looking at ron and harry.
harry had never seen her look so angry.
her lips were white.
hopes of winning fifty points for  GRYFFINDOR faded quickly from harry's mind.
"what on earth were you thinking of?"
said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, with cold fury in her voice.
harry looked at ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.
"you're lucky you weren't killed.
why aren't you in your dormitory?"
 SNAPE gave harry a swift, piercing look.
harry looked at the floor.
he wished ron would put his wand down.
then a small voice came out of the shadows.
"please, professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL -- they were looking for me."
"miss  GRANger!"
 HERMLONE had managed to get to her feet at last.
i went looking for the troll because i -- i thought i could deal with it on my own -- you know, because i've read all about them."
ron dropped his wand.
 HERMIONE_GRANGER, telling a downright lie to a teacher?
"if they hadn't found me, i'd be dead now.
harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club.
they didn't have time to come and fetch anyone.
it was about to finish me off when they arrived."
harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.
"well -- in that case..." said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, staring at the three of them, "miss  GRANger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
 HERMLONE hung her head.
harry was speechless.
 HERMLONE was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.
it was as if  SNAPE had star TED handing out sweets.
"miss  GRANger, five points will be taken from  GRYFFINDOR for this," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"i'm very disappoin TED in you.
if you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to  GRYFFINDOR tower.
students are finishing the feast in their houses."
 HERMLONE left.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL turned to harry and ron.
"well, i still say you were lucky, but not many first  YEWars could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.
you each win  GRYFFINDOR five points.
professor  DUmbledore will be informed of this.
you may go."
they hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.
it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.
"we should have gotten more than ten points," ron grumbled.
"five, you mean, once she's taken off  HERMLONE's."
"good of her to get us out of trouble like that," ron admit TED.
"mind you, we did save her."
"she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her," harry reminded him.
they had reached the portrait of the fat lady.
"pig snout," they said and entered.
the common room was packed and noisy.
everyone was eating the food that had been sent up.
 HERMLONE, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.
there was a very embarrassed pause.
then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "thanks," and hurried off to get plates.
but from that  MOMent on,  HERMIONE_GRANGER became their friend.
there are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
chapter eleven.
quidditch.
as they entered november, the weather turned very cold.
the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel.
every morning the ground was covered in frost.
hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
the quidditch season had begun.
on saturday, harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training:  GRYFFINDOR versus  SLYTHERINS.
if  GRYFFINDOR won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.
hardly anyone had seen harry play because  WOOD had decided that, as their secret weapon, harry should be kept, well, secret.
but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow, and harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
it was really lucky that harry now had  HERMLONE as a friend.
he didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute quidditch practice  WOOD was making them do.
she had also tent him quidditch through the ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.
harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened  DUring a world cup match in 1473; that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest pla YEWrs, and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert.
 HERMLONE had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.
the day before harry's first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard  DUring break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
they were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when  SNAPE crossed the yard.
harry noticed at once that  SNAPE was limping.
harry, ron, and  HERMLONE moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed.
unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught  SNAPE's e YEW.
he limped over.
he hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
"what's that you've got there,  POTTER?"
it was quidditch through the ages.
harry showed him.
"library books are not to be taken outside the school," said  SNAPE.
"give it to me.
five points from  GRYFFINDOR."
"he's just made that rule up," harry muttered angrily as  SNAPE limped away.
"wonder what's wrong with his leg?"
" DUnno, but i hope it's really hurting him," said ron bitterly.
the  GRYFFINDOR common room was very noisy that evening.
harry, ron, and  HERMLONE sat together next to a window.
 HERMLONE was checking harry and ron's charms homework for them.
she would never let them copy ("how will you learn?
"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.
harry felt restless.
he wan TED quidditch through the ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about  TOMorrow.
why should he be afraid of  SNAPE?
getting up, he told ron and  HERMLONE he was going to ask  SNAPE if he could have it.
"better you than me," they said together, but harry had an idea that  SNAPE wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.
there was no answer.
he knocked again.
nothing.
perhaps  SNAPE had left the book in there?
it was worth a try.
he pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his e YEWs.
 SNAPE and  FILCH were inside, alone.
 SNAPE was holding his robes above his knees.
one of his legs was bloody and mangled.
 FILCH was handing  SNAPE bandages.
"blas TED thing*,"  SNAPE was saying.
"how are you supposed to keep your e YEWs on all three heads at once?"
harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --
    " POTTER!"
 SNAPE's face was twis TED with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.
harry gulped.
"i just wondered if i could have my book back."
"get out!
out!"
harry left, before  SNAPE could take any more points from  GRYFFINDOR.
he sprin TED back upstairs.
"did you get it?"
ron asked as harry joined them.
"what's the matter?"
in a low whisper, harry told them what he'd seen.
"you know what this means?"
he finished breathlessly.
"he tried to get past that three-headed dog at halloween!
that's where he was going when we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding!
and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!"
 HERMLONE's e YEWs were wide.
"no -- he wouldn't, she said.
"i know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something  DUmbledore was keeping safe."
"honestly,  HERMLONE, you think all teachers are saints or something," snapped ron.
"i'm with harry.
i wouldn't put anything past  SNAPE.
but what's he after?
what's that dog guarding?"
harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM was snoring loudly, but harry couldn't s LEE_JORDANp.
he tried to empty his mind -- he needed to s LEE_JORDANp, he had to, he had his first quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on  SNAPE's face when harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget.
the next morning dawned very bright and cold.
the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match.
"you've got to eat some breakfast."
"i  DON't want anything."
"just a bit of toast," wheedled  HERMLONE.
"i'm not hungry."
harry felt terrible.
in an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
"harry, you need your strength," said  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN.
"seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."
"thanks,  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN," said harry, watching  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN pile ketchup on his sausages.
by eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch.
many students had binoculars.
the seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
ron and  HERMLONE joined  MR._LONGBOTTOM,  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN, and  DEAN_THOMAS the west ham fan up in the top row.
as a surprise for harry, they had pain TED a large banner on one of the sheets  SCABBERS had ruined.
it said  POTTER for president, and  DEAN_THOMAS, who was good at drawing, had  DONe a large  GRYFFINDOR lion underneath.
then  HERMLONE had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
meanwhile, in the locker room, harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes ( SLYTHERINS would be playing in green).
 WOOD cleared his throat for silence.
"okay, men," he said.
"and women," said  CHASER_ANGELINA_JOHNSON.
"and women,"  WOOD agreed.
"this is it."
"the big one," said  FRED_WEASLEY.
"the one we've all been waiting for," said  GEORGE_WEASLEY.
"we know  OLIVER_WOOD's speech by heart,"  FRED_WEASLEY told harry, "we were on the team last  YEWar."
"shut up, you two," said  WOOD.
"this is the best team  GRYFFINDOR's had in  YEWars.
we're going to win.
i know it."
he glared at them all as if to say, "or else."
"right.
it's time.
good luck, all of you."
harry followed  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
 MADAM_HOOCH was refereeing.
she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
"now, i want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her.
harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the  SLYTHERINS captain,  MARCUS_FLINT, a sixth  YEWar.
harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him.
out of the corner of his e YEW he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing  POTTER for president over the crowd.
his heart skipped.
he felt braver.
"mount your brooms, please."
harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand.
 MADAM_HOOCH gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air.
they were off.
"and the quaffle is taken immediately by  CHASER_ANGELINA_JOHNSON of  GRYFFINDOR -- what an excellent chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --"
    " LEE_JORDAN!"
"sorry, professor."
the weasley twins' friend,  LEE_JORDAN, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"and she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to  ALICIA_SPINNET, a good find of  OLIVER_WOOD's, last  YEWar only a reserve -- back to  JOHNSON and -- no, the  SLYTHERINS have taken the quaffle,  SLYTHERINS captain  MARCUS_FLINT gains the quaffle and off he goes -- flint flying like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by  GRYFFINDOR keeper  WOOD and the  GRYFFINDORs take the quaffle -- that's  CHASER_KATIE_BELL of  GRYFFINDOR there, nice dive around flint, off up the field and -- ouch -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a bludger -- quaffle taken by the  SLYTHERINS -- that's  ADRIAN_PUCEY speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second bludger -- sent his way by  FRED_WEASLEY or  GEORGE_WEASLEY, can't tell which -- nice play by the  GRYFFINDOR beater, anyway, and  JOHNSON back in possession of the quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's really flying -- dodges a speeding bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, angelina -- keeper  BLETCHLEY dives -- misses --  GRYFFINDORs score!"
 GRYFFINDOR cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the  SLYTHERINS.
"budge up there, move along."
"hagrid!"
ron and  HERMLONE squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them.
"bin watchin' from me hut," said hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, "but it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd.
no sign of the snitch  YEWt, eh?"
"nope," said ron.
"harry hasn't had much to do  YEWt."
"kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry.
way up above them, harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the snitch.
this was part of his and  WOOD's game plan.
"keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch,"  WOOD had said.
"we  DON't want you attacked before you have to be."
when angelina had scored, harry had  DONe a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings.
now he was back to staring around for the snitch.
once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the  MRS._WEASLEY' wristwatches, and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but harry dodged it and  FRED_WEASLEY came  CHASINg after it.
"all right there, harry?"
he had time to  YEWll, as he beat the bludger furiously toward  MARCUS_FLINT.
" SLYTHERINS in possession,"  LEE_JORDAN was saying, "chaser pucey  DUcks two bludgers, two  MRS._WEASLEY, and  CHASER_KATIE_BELL, and speeds toward the -- wait a  MOMent -- was that the snitch?"
a murmur ran through the crowd as  ADRIAN_PUCEY dropped the quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.
harry saw it.
in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold.
 SLYTHERINS seeker  TERENCE_HIGGS had seen it, too.
neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch -all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.
harry was faster than  TERENCE_HIGGS -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --
    wham!
a roar of rage echoed from the  GRYFFINDORs below --  MARCUS_FLINT had blocked harry on purpose, and harry's broom spun off course, harry holding on for dear life.
"foul!"
screamed the  GRYFFINDORs.
 MADAM_HOOCH spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for  GRYFFINDOR.
but in all the confusion, of course, the  GOLDEN_SNITCH had disappeared from sight again.
down in the stands,  DEAN_THOMAS  THOMAS was  YEWlling, "send him off, ref!
red card!"
"what are you talking about,  DEAN_THOMAS?"
said ron.
"red card!"
said  DEAN_THOMAS furiously.
"in soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!"
"but this isn't soccer,  DEAN_THOMAS," ron reminded him.
hagrid, however, was on  DEAN_THOMAS's side.
"they oughta change the rules.
flint coulda knocked harry outta the air."
 LEE_JORDAN was finding it difficult not to take sides.
"so -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
    " LEE_JORDAN!"
growled professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"i mean, after that open and revolting foul
    ' LEE_JORDAN, i'm warning you --"
    "all right, all right.
flint nearly kills the  GRYFFINDOR seeker, which could happen to anyone, i'm sure, so a penalty to  GRYFFINDOR, taken by spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play,  GRYFFINDOR still in possession."
it was as harry dodged another bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.
his broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.
for a split second, he thought he was going to fall.
he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees.
he'd never felt anything like that.
it happened again.
it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.
but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.
harry tried to turn back toward the  GRYFFINDOR goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask  WOOD to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.
he couldn't turn it.
he couldn't direct it at all.
it was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unsea TED him.
 LEE_JORDAN was still commentating.
" SLYTHERINS in possession -- flint with the quaffle -- passes spinnet -- passes  CHASER_KATIE_BELL -- hit hard in the face by a bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, professor --  SLYTHERINS score -- a no...
the  SLYTHERINS were cheering.
no one seemed to have noticed that harry's broom was behaving strangely.
it was carrying- him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
" DUnno what harry thinks he's doing," hagrid mumbled.
he stared through his binoculars.
"if i didn' know better, i'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...."
    suddenly, people were pointing up at harry all over the stands.
his broom had star TED to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.
then the whole crowd gasped.
harry's broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it.
he was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.
"did something happen to it when flint blocked him?"
 SEAMUS_FINNIGAN whispered.
"can't have," hagrid said, his voice shaking.
"can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic -- no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand."
at these words,  HERMLONE seized hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at harry, she star TED looking frantically at the crowd.
"what are you doing?"
moaned ron, gray-faced.
"i knew it,"  HERMLONE gasped, " SNAPE -- look."
ron grabbed the binoculars.
 SNAPE was in the middle of the stands opposite them.
he had his e YEWs fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.
"he's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said  HERMLONE.
"what should we do?"
"leave it to me."
before ron could say another word,  HERMLONE had disappeared.
ron turned the binoculars back on harry.
his broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer.
the whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the  MRS._WEASLEY flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still.
they dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.
marcus
    flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
"come on,  HERMLONE," ron muttered desperately.
 HERMLONE had fought her way across to the stand where  SNAPE stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor  QUIRTELL headfirst into the row in front.
reaching  SNAPE, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words.
bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of  SNAPE's robes.
it took perhaps thirty seconds for  SNAPE to realize that he was on fire.
a sudden  YEWlp told her she had  DONe her job.
scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --  SNAPE would never know what had happened.
it was enough.
up in the air, harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.
" MR._LONGBOTTOM, you can look!"
ron said.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM had been sobbing into hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
"i've got the snitch!"
he shou TED, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.
"he didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- harry hadn't broken any rules and  LEE_JORDAN was still happily shouting the results --  GRYFFINDOR had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.
harry heard none of this, though.
he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid's hut, with ron and  HERMLONE.
"it was  SNAPE," ron was explaining, " HERMLONE and i saw him.
he was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his e YEWs off you."
"rubbish," said hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands.
"why would  SNAPE do somethin' like that?"
harry, ron, and  HERMLONE looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.
harry decided on the truth.
"i found out something about him," he told hagrid.
"he tried to get past that three-headed dog on halloween.
it bit him.
we think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding."
hagrid dropped the teapot.
"how do you know about  FLUFFY?"
he said.
" FLUFFY?"
" YEWah -- he's mine -- bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las'  YEWar -- i lent him to  DUmbledore to guard the
    " YEWs?"
said harry eagerly.
"now,  DON't ask me anymore," said hagrid gruffly.
"that's top secret, that is."
"but  SNAPE's trying to steal it."
"rubbish," said hagrid again.
" SNAPE's a hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort."
"so why did he just try and kill harry?"
cried  HERMLONE.
the afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about  SNAPE.
i know a jinx when i see one, hagrid, i've read all about them!
you've got to keep e YEW contact, and  SNAPE wasn't blinking at all, i saw him!"
"i'm tellin'  YEWh,  YEWr wrong!"
said hagrid hotly.
"i  DON' know why harry's broom ac TED like that, but  SNAPE wouldn' try an' kill a student!
now, listen to me, all three of  YEWh --  YEWr meddlin' in things that  DON' concern  YEWh.
it's dangerous.
you forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between professor  DUmbledore an'  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel --"
    "aha!"
said harry, "so there's someone called  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel involved, is there?"
hagrid looked furious with himself.
chapter twelve.
the mirror of erised.
christmas was coming.
one morning in mid-december, hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow.
the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed  QUIRTELL around, bouncing off the back of his turban.
the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again.
no one could wait for the holidays to start.
while the  GRYFFINDOR common room and the great hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.
worst of all were professor  SNAPE's classes down in the  DUngeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.
"i do feel so sorry," said draco  MALFOY, one potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they're not wan TED at home."
he was looking over at harry as he spoke.
 CRABBE and  GOYLE chuckled.
harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
 MALFOY had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match.
disgus TED that the  SLYTHERINS had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next.
then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.
so  MALFOY, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family.
it was true that harry wasn't going back to privet drive for christmas.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and harry had signed up at once.
he didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best christmas he'd ever had.
ron and his brothers were staying, too, because mr. and  MRS._WEASLEY were going to romania to visit charlie.
when they left the  DUngeons at the end of potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.
two enormous feet sticking out at the bot TOM and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it.
"hi, hagrid, want any help?"
ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.
"nah, i'm all right, thanks, ron."
"would you mind moving out of the way?"
came  MALFOYs cold drawl from behind them.
"are you trying to earn some extra money, weasley?
hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts, i suppose -- that hut of hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to."
ron dived at  MALFOY just as  SNAPE came up the stairs.
"weasley!"
ron let go of the front of  MALFOY's robes.
"he was provoked, professor  SNAPE," said hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.
" MALFOY was insultin' his family."
"be that as it may, fighting is against hogwarts rules, hagrid," said  SNAPE silkily.
"five points from  GRYFFINDOR, weasley, and be grateful it isn't more.
move along, all of you."
 MALFOY,  CRABBE, and  GOYLE pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
"i'll get him," said ron, grinding his teeth at  MALFOY's back, "one of these days, i'll get him --"
    "i hate them both," said harry, " MALFOY and  SNAPE."
"come on, cheer up, it's nearly christmas," said hagrid.
"tell  YEWh what, come with me an' see the great hall, looks a treat."
so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to -the great hall, where professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL and professor  FLITWICK were busy with the christmas decorations.
"ah, hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"
the hall looked spectacular.
festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.
"how many days you got left until  YEWr holidays?"
hagrid asked.
"just one," said  HERMLONE.
"and that reminds me -harry, ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"oh  YEWah, you're right," said ron, tearing his e YEWs away from professor  FLITWICK, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
"the library?"
said hagrid, following them out of the hall.
"just before the holidays?
bit keen, aren't  YEWh?"
"oh, we're not working," harry told him brightly.
"ever since you mentioned  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel we've been trying to find out who he is."
"you what?"
hagrid looked shocked.
"listen here -- i've told  YEWh -- drop it.
it's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
"we just want to know who  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel is, that's all," said  HERMLONE.
"unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?"
harry added.
"we must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- i know i've read his name somewhere."
"i'm sayin' nothin, said hagrid flatly.
"just have to find out for ourselves, then," said ron, and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
they had indeed been searching books for flamel's name ever since hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what  SNAPE was trying to steal?
the trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what flamel might have  DONe to get himself into a book.
he wasn't in great wizards of the twentieth century, or notable magical names of our time; he was missing, too, from important modern magical discoveries, and a study of recent developments in wizardry.
and then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
 HERMLONE took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and star TED pulling them off the shelves at random.
harry wandered over to the restric TED section.
he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn't somewhere in there.
unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restric TED books, and he knew he'd never get one.
these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts.
"what are you looking for, boy?"
"nothing," said harry.
 MADAM_PINCE the librarian brandished a feather  DUster at him.
"you'd better get out, then.
go on -- out!"
wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, harry left the library.
he, ron, and  HERMLONE had already agreed they'd better not ask  MADAM_PINCE where they could find flamel.
they were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk  SNAPE hearing what they were up to.
harry wai TED outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful.
they had been looking for two weeks, after a, but as they only had odd  MOMents between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing.
what they really needed was a nice long search without  MADAM_PINCE breathing down their necks.
five minutes later, ron and  HERMLONE joined him, shaking their heads.
they went off to lunch.
"you will keep looking while i'm away, won't you?"
said  HERMLONE.
"and send me an owl if you find anything."
"and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is," said ron.
"it'd be safe to ask them."
"very safe, as they're both dentists," said  HERMLONE.
once the holidays had star TED, ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel.
they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.
they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, english muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting  MALFOY expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.
ron also star TED teaching harry wizard chess.
this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.
ron's set was very old and battered.
like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his  GRANdfather.
however, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all.
ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wan TED.
harry pla YEWd with chessmen  SEAMUS_FINNIGAN had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all.
he wasn't a very good pla YEWr  YEWt and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.
" DON't send me there, can't you see his knight?
send him, we can afford to lose him."
on christmas eve, harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.
when he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
"merry christmas," said ron s LEE_JORDANpily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.
"you, too," said harry.
"will you look at this?
i've got some presents!"
"what did you expect, turnips?"
said ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than harry's.
harry picked up the top parcel.
it was wrapped in thick  BROWN paper and scrawled across it was to harry, from hagrid.
inside was a roughly cut  WOODen flute.
hagrid had obviously whittled it himself.
harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.
a second, very small parcel contained a note.
we received your message and enclose your christmas present.
from  UNCLE_VERNON and  AUNT_PETUNIA.
taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.
"that's friendly," said harry.
ron was fascina TED by the fifty pence.
"weird!"
he said, 'nmat a shape!
this is money?"
"you can keep it," said harry, laughing at how pleased ron was.
"hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?"
"i think i know who that one's from," said ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.
"my  MOM.
i told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a weasley sweater."
harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knit TED sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
"every  YEWar she makes us a sweater," said ron, unwrapping his own, "and mine's always maroon."
"that's really nice of her," said harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.
his next present also contained candy -- a large box of chocolate frogs from  HERMLONE.
this only left one parcel.
harry picked it up and felt it.
it was very light.
he unwrapped it.
something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.
ron gasped.
"i've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of every flavor beans he'd gotten from  HERMLONE.
"if that's what i think it is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."
"what is it?"
harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor.
it was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.
"it's an invisibility cl OAK," said ron, a look of awe on his face.
"i'm sure it is -- try it on."
harry threw the cl OAK around his shoulders and ron gave a  YEWll.
"it is!
look down!"
harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone.
he dashed to the mirror.
sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible.
he pulled the cl OAK over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
"there's a note!"
said ron suddenly.
"a note fell out of it!"
harry pulled off the cl OAK and seized the letter.
written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: your father left this in my possession before he died.
it is time it was returned to you.
use it well.
a very merry christmas to you.
there was no signature.
harry stared at the note.
ron was admiring the cl OAK.
"i'd give anything for one of these," he said.
"anything.
what's the matter?"
"nothing," said harry.
he felt very strange.
who had sent the cl OAK?
had it really once belonged to his father?
before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY bounded in.
harry stuffed the cl OAK quickly out of sight.
he didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else  YEWt.
"merry christmas!"
"hey, look -- harry's got a weasley sweater, too!"
 FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large  YEWllow f on it, the other a g.
    "harry's is better than ours, though," said  FRED_WEASLEY, holding up harry's sweater.
"she obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
"why aren't you wearing yours, ron?"
 GEORGE_WEASLEY demanded.
"come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm."
"i hate maroon," ron moaned halfhear TEDly as he pulled it over his head.
"you haven't got a letter on yours,"  GEORGE_WEASLEY observed.
"i suppose she thinks you  DON't forget your name.
but we're not stupid -- we know we're called  GRED and forge."
"what's all th is noise.
 PERCY_WEASLEY stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving.
he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which
     FRED_WEASLEY seized.
"p for prefect!
get it on,  PERCY_WEASLEY, come on, we're all wearing ours, even harry got one."
"i --  DON't -- want said  PERCY_WEASLEY thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
"and you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said
     GEORGE_WEASLEY.
"christmas is a time for family."
they frog-marched  PERCY_WEASLEY from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.
harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner.
a hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table.
these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the  DURSLEYS usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.
harry pulled a wizard cracker with  FRED_WEASLEY and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice.
up at the high table,  DUmbledore had swapped his poin TED wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor  FLITWICK had just read him.
flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey.
 PERCY_WEASLEY nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice.
harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL on the cheek, who, to harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
when harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a grow-your-own-warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs.  NORRIS's christmas dinner.
harry and the  MRS._WEASLEY spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.
then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the  GRYFFINDOR common room, where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron.
he suspec TED he wouldn't have lost so badly if  PERCY_WEASLEY hadn't tried to help him so much.
after a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and christmas cake, everyone felt too full and s LEE_JORDANpy to do much before bed except sit and watch  PERCY_WEASLEY chase  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY all over  GRYFFINDOR tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.
it had been harry's best christmas day ever.
 YEWt something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day.
not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cl OAK and whoever had sent it.
ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell as LEE_JORDANp almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster.
harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cl OAK out from under it.
his father's... this had been his father's.
he let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.
use it well, the note had said.
he had to try it, now.
he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cl OAK around himself.
looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.
it was a very funny feeling.
use it well.
suddenly, harry felt wide-awake.
the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cl OAK.
excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence.
he could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and  FILCH would never know.
ron grun TED in his s LEE_JORDANp.
should harry wake him?
something held him back -- his father's cl OAK -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wan TED to use it alone.
he crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.
"who's there?"
squawked the fat lady.
harry said nothing.
he walked quickly down the corridor.
where should he go?
he stopped, his heart racing, and thought.
and then it came to him.
the restric TED section in the library.
he'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who flamel was.
he set off, drawing the invisibility cl OAK tight around him as he walked.
the library was pitch-black and very eerie.
harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.
the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.
the restric TED section was right at the back of the library.
step ping carefully over the rope that separa TED these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.
they didn't tell him much.
their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldn't understand.
some had no title at all.
one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.
the hairs on the back of harry's neck prickled.
maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
he had to start somewhere.
setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bot TOM shelf for an interestinglooking book.
a large black and silver volume caught his e YEW.
he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.
a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming!
harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.
he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.
pa NICKing, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it.
he passed  FILCH in the doorway;  FILCH's pale, wild e YEWs looked straight through him, and harry slipped under  FILCH's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.
he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.
he had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going.
perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all.
there was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.
"you asked me to come directly to you, professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library restric TED section."
harry felt the blood drain out of his face.
wherever he was,  FILCH must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was  SNAPE who replied, "the restric TED section?
well, they can't be far, we'll catch them."
harry stood roo TED to the spot as  FILCH and  SNAPE came around the corner ahead.
they couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cl OAK didn't stop him from being solid.
he backed away as quietly as he could.
a door stood ajar to his left.
it was his only hope.
he squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything.
they walked straight past, and harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.
that had been close, very close.
it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
it looked like an unused classroom.
the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
it was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.
there was an inscription carved around the top: erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
his panic fading now that there was no sound of  FILCH and  SNAPE, harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.
he stepped in front of it.
he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming.
he whirled around.
his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
but the room was empty.
breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.
there he was, reflec TED in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflec TED behind him, were at least ten others.
harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there.
or were they all invisible, too?
was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflec TED them, invisible or not?
he looked in the mirror again.
a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.
he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him.
if she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others exis TED only in the mirror.
she was a very pretty woman.
she had dark red hair and her e YEWs -- her e YEWs are just like mine, harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.
bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.
the tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her.
he wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.
it stuck up at the back, just as harry's did.
harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.
" MOM?"
he whispered.
"dad?"
they just looked at him, smiling.
and slowly, harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green e YEWs like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had harry's knobbly knees -- harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
the  POTTERs smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.
he had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
how long he stood there, he didn't know.
the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.
he couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed.
he tore his e YEWs away from his  MOTHER's face, whispered, "i'll come back," and hurried from the room.
"you could have woken me up," said ron, crossly.
"you can come tonight, i'm going back, i want to show you the mirror.
"i'd like to see your  MOM and dad," ron said eagerly.
"and i want to see all your family, all the  MRS._WEASLEY, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone."
"you can see them any old time," said ron.
"just come round my house this summer.
anyway, maybe it only shows dead people.
shame about not finding flamel, though.
have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?"
harry couldn't eat.
he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight.
he had almost forgotten about flamel.
it didn't seem very important anymore.
who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?
what did it matter if  SNAPE stole it, really?
"are you all right?"
said ron.
"you look odd."
what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again.
with ron covered in the cl OAK, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.
they tried retracing harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
"i'm freezing," said ron.
"let's forget it and go back."
"no!"
harry hissed.
i know it's here somewhere."
they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.
just as ron star TED moaning that his feet were dead with cold, harry spot TED the suit of armor.
"it's here -- just here --  YEWs!"
they pushed the door open.
harry dropped the cl OAK from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
there they were.
his  MOTHER and father beamed at the sight of him.
"see?"
harry whispered.
"i can't see anything."
"look!
look at them all... there are loads of them...."
    "i can only see you."
"look in it properly, go on, stand where i am."
harry stepped aside, but with ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just ron in his paisley pajamas.
ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
"look at me!"
he said.
"can you see all your family standing around you?"
"no -- i'm alone -- but i'm different -- i look older -- and i'm head boy!"
"what?"
"i am -- i'm wearing the badge like  BILL used to -- and i'm holding the house cup and the quidditch cup -- i'm quidditch captain, too.
ron tore his e YEWs away from this splendid sight to look exci TEDly at harry.
"do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"how can it?
all my family are dead -- let me have another look --"
    "you had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
"you're only holding the quidditch cup, what's interesting about that?
i want to see my parents."
" DON't push me --"
    a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
they hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
"quick!"
ron threw the cl OAK back over them as the luminous e YEWs of mrs.  NORRIS came round the door.
ron and harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cl OAK work on cats?
after what seemed an age, she turned and left.
"this isn't safe -- she might have gone for  FILCH, i bet she heard us.
come on."
and ron pulled harry out of the room.
the snow still hadn't mel TED the next morning.
"want to play chess, harry?"
said ron.
"no."
"why  DON't we go down and visit hagrid?"
"no... you go..."
    "i know what you're thinking about, harry, that mirror.
 DON't go back tonight."
"why not?"
"i  DUnno, i've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already.
 FILCH,  SNAPE, and mrs.  NORRIS are wandering around.
so what if they can't see you?
what if they walk into you?
what if you knock something over?"
"you sound like  HERMLONE."
"i'm serious, harry,  DON't go."
but harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and ron wasn't going to stop him.
that third night he found his way more quickly than before.
he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.
and there were his  MOTHER and father smiling at him again, and one of his  GRANdfathers nodding happily.
harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.
there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.
nothing at all.
except --
    "so -- back again, harry?"
harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.
he looked behind him.
sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE.
harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.
    "
-- i didn't see you, sir."
"strange how nearsigh TED being invisible can make you," said  DUmbledore, and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
"so," said  DUmbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised."
"i didn't know it was called that, sir."
"but i expect you've realized by now what it does?"
"it -- well -- it shows me my family --"
    "and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy."
"how did you know --?"
"i  DON't need a cl OAK to become invisible," said  DUmbledore gently.
"now, can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all?"
harry shook his head.
"let me explain.
the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.
does that help?"
harry thought.
then he said slowly, "it shows us what we want... whatever we want..."
    " YEWs and no," said  DUmbledore quietly.
"it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.
you, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.
 RONALD_WEASLEY, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.
however, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.
men have was TED away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
"the mirror will be moved to a new home  TOMorrow, harry, and i ask you not to go looking for it again.
if you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared.
it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.
now, why  DON't you put that admirable cl OAK back on and get off to bed?"
harry stood up.
"sir -- professor  DUmbledore?
can i ask you something?"
"obviously, you've just  DONe so,"  DUmbledore smiled.
"you may ask me one more thing, however."
"what do you see when you look in the mirror?"
"i?
i see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
harry stared.
"one can never have enough socks," said  DUmbledore.
"another christmas has come and gone and i didn't get a single pair.
people will insist on giving me books."
it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that  DUmbledore might not have been quite truthful.
but then, he thought, as he shoved  SCABBERS off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
chapter thirteen.
 MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel.
 DUmbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again, and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cl OAK sta YEWd folded at the bot TOM of his trunk.
harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't.
he star TED having nightmares.
over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
"you see,  DUmbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said ron, when harry told him about these drearns.
 HERMLONE, who came back the day before term star TED, took a different view of things.
she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("if  FILCH had caught you!
"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel was.
they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li- brary book, even though harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.
once term had star TED, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes  DUring their breaks.
harry had even less time than the other two, because quidditch practice had star TED again.
 WOOD was working the team harder than ever.
even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.
the  MRS._WEASLEY complained that  WOOD was becoming a fanatic, but harry was on  WOOD's side.
if they won their next match, against  HUFFLEPUFFS, they would overtake  SLYTHERINS in the house championship for the first time in seven  YEWars.
quite apart from wanting to win, harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.
then,  DUring one particularly wet and muddy practice session,  WOOD gave the team a bit of bad news.
he'd just gotten very angry with the  MRS._WEASLEY, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.
"will you stop messing around!"
he  YEWlled.
"that's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match!
 SNAPE's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off  GRYFFINDOR!"
 GEORGE_WEASLEY really did fall off his broom at these words.
" SNAPE's refereeing?"
he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
"when's he ever refereed a quidditch match?
he's not going to be fair if we might overtake  SLYTHERINS."
the rest of the team landed next to  GEORGE_WEASLEY to complain, too.
"it's not my fault," said  WOOD.
"we've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so  SNAPE hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
which was all very well, thought harry, but he had another reason for not wanting  SNAPE near him while he was playing quidditch....
the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but harry headed straight back to the  GRYFFINDOR common room, where he found ron and  HERMLONE playing chess.
chess was the only thing  HERMLONE ever lost at, something harry and ron thought was very good for her.
" DON't talk to me for a  MOMent," said ron when harry sat down next to him, "i need to concen --" he caught sight of harry's face.
"what's the matter with you?
you look terrible."
speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, harry told the other two about  SNAPE's sudden, sinister desire to be a quidditch referee.
" DON't play," said  HERMLONE at once.
"say you're ill," said ron.
"pretend to break your leg,"  HERMLONE sugges TED.
"really break your leg," said ron.
"i can't," said harry.
"there isn't a reserve seeker.
if i back out,  GRYFFINDOR can't play at all."
at that  MOMent  MR._LONGBOTTOM toppled into the common room.
how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg-locker curse.
he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to  GRYFFINDOR tower.
everyone fell over laughing except  HERMLONE, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.
"what happened?"
 HERMLONE asked him, leading him over to sit with harry and ron.
" MALFOY," said  MR._LONGBOTTOM shakily.
"i met him outside the library.
he said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
"go to professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL!"
 HERMLONE urged  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"report him!"
 MR._LONGBOTTOM shook his head.
"i  DON't want more trouble," he mumbled.
"you've got to stand up to him,  MR._LONGBOTTOM!"
said ron.
"he's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier."
"there's no need to tell me i'm not brave enough to be in  GRYFFINDOR,  MALFOY's already  DONe that,"  MR._LONGBOTTOM choked out.
harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog, the very last one from the box  HERMLONE had given him for christmas.
he gave it to  MR._LONGBOTTOM, who looked as though he might cry.
"you're worth twelve of  MALFOY," harry said.
"the sorting hat chose you for  GRYFFINDOR, didn't it?
and where's  MALFOY?
in stinking  SLYTHERINS."
 MR._LONGBOTTOM's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.
"thanks, harry...
i think i'll go to bed.... d'you want the card, you collect them,  DON't you?"
as  MR._LONGBOTTOM walked away, harry looked at the famous wizard card.
" DUmbledore again," he said, "he was the first one i ever-"
    he gasped.
he stared at the back of the card.
then he looked up at ron and  HERMLONE.
"i've found him!"
he whispered.
"i've found flamel!
i told you i'd read the name somewhere before, i read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: ' DUmbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner,  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel'!"
 HERMLONE jumped to her feet.
she hadn't looked so exci TED since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.
"stay there!"
she said, and she sprin TED up the stairs to the girls' dormitories.
harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
"i never thought to look in here!"
she whispered exci TEDly.
"i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"light?"
said ron, but  HERMLONE told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and star TED flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.
at last she found what she was looking for.
"i knew it!
i knew it!"
"are we allowed to speak  YEWt?"
said ron grumpily.
 HERMLONE ignored him.
" MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone!"
this didn't have quite the effect she'd expec TED.
"the what?"
said harry and ron.
"oh, honestly,  DON't you two read?
look -- read that, there."
she pushed the book toward them, and harry and ron read: the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer's stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
the stone will transform any metal into pure gold.
it also pro DUces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal.
there have been many reports of the sorcerer's stone over the centuries, but the only stone currently in existence belongs to  MR._DUMBLEDORE, the no TED alchemist and opera lover.
 MR._DUMBLEDORE, who celebra TED his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last  YEWar, enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife,  PERENELLE (six hundred and fifty-eight).
"see?"
said  HERMLONE, when harry and ron had finished.
"the dog must be guarding flamel's sorcerer's stone!
i bet he asked  DUmbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wan TED the stone moved out of  GRINGOTTS!"
"a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"
said harry.
"no wonder  SNAPE's after it!
anyone would want it."
"and no wonder we couldn't find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry," said ron.
"he's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
the next morning in defense against the dark arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, harry and ron were still discussing what they'd do with a sorcerer's stone if they had one.
it wasn't until ron said he'd buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about  SNAPE and the coming match.
"i'm going to play," he told ron and  HERMLONE.
"if i  DON't, all the  SLYTHERINS will think i'm just too scared to face  SNAPE.
i'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
"just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said  HERMLONE.
as the match drew nearer, however, harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told ron and  HERMLONE.
the rest of the team wasn't too calm, either.
the idea of overtaking  SLYTHERINS in the house championship was wonderful, no one had  DONe it for seven  YEWars, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into  SNAPE wherever he went.
at times, he even wondered whether  SNAPE was following him, trying to catch him on his own.
potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture,  SNAPE was so horrible to harry.
could  SNAPE possibly know they'd found out about the sorcerer's stone?
harry didn't see how he could --  YEWt he sometimes had the horrible feeling that  SNAPE could read minds.
harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that ron and  HERMLONE were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again.
this wasn't what you'd call comforting.
harry hardly heard a word of  WOOD's pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand.
ron and  HERMLONE, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to  MR._LONGBOTTOM, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.
little did harry know that ron and  HERMLONE had been secretly practicing the leg-locker curse.
they'd gotten the idea from  MALFOY using it on  MR._LONGBOTTOM, and were ready to use it on  SNAPE if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry.
"now,  DON't forget, it's locomotor mortis,"  HERMLONE muttered as ron slipped his wand up his s LEE_JORDANve.
"i know," ron snapped.
" DON't nag."
back in the locker room,  WOOD had taken harry aside.
" DON't want to pressure you,  POTTER, but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it's now.
finish the game before  SNAPE can favor  HUFFLEPUFFS too much."
"the whole school's out there!"
said  FRED_WEASLEY, peering out of the door.
"even -- blimey --  DUmbledore's come to watch!"
harry's heart did a somersault.
" DUmbledore?"
he said, dashing to the door to make sure.
 FRED_WEASLEY was right.
there was no mistaking that silver beard.
harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe.
there was simply no way that  SNAPE would dare to try to hurt him if  DUmbledore was watching.
perhaps that was why  SNAPE was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that ron noticed, too.
"i've never seen  SNAPE look so mean," he told  HERMLONE.
"look -they're off ouch!"
someone had poked ron in the back of the head.
it was  MALFOY.
"oh, sorry, weasley, didn't see you there."
 MALFOY grinned broadly at  CRABBE and  GOYLE.
"wonder how long  POTTER's going to stay on his broom this time?
anyone want a bet?
what about you, weasley?"
ron didn't answer;  SNAPE had just awarded  HUFFLEPUFFS a penalty because  GEORGE_WEASLEY had hit a bludger at him.
 HERMLONE, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the snitch.
"you know how i think they choose people for the  GRYFFINDOR team?"
said  MALFOY loudly a few minutes later, as  SNAPE awarded  HUFFLEPUFFS another penalty for no reason at all.
"it's people they feel sorry for.
see, there's  POTTER, who's got no parents, then there's the  MRS._WEASLEY, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, longbot TOM, you've got no brains."
 MR._LONGBOTTOM went bright red but turned in his seat to face  MALFOY.
"i'm worth twelve of you,  MALFOY," he stammered.
 MALFOY,  CRABBE, and  GOYLE howled with laughter, but ron, still not daring to take his e YEWs from the game, said, "you tell him,  MR._LONGBOTTOM."
"longbot TOM, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than weasley, and that's saying something."
ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry.
"i'm warning you,  MALFOY -- one more word
    "ron!"
said  HERMLONE suddenly, "harry --"
    "what?
where?"
harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.
 HERMLONE stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
"you're in luck, weasley,  POTTER's obviously spot TED some money on the ground!"
said  MALFOY.
ron snapped.
before  MALFOY knew what was happening, ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM hesita TED, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
"come on, harry!"
 HERMLONE screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at  SNAPE -- she didn't even notice  MALFOY and ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and  YEWlps coming from the whirl of fists that was  MR._LONGBOTTOM,  CRABBE, and  GOYLE.
up in the air,  SNAPE turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the snitch clasped in his hand.
the stands erup TED; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly.
"ron!
ron!
where are you?
the game's over!
harry's won!
we've won!
 GRYFFINDOR is in the lead!"
shrieked  HERMLONE, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati  PATIL in the row in front.
harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.
he couldn't believe it.
he'd  DONe it -- the game was over; it had barely las TED five minutes.
as  GRYFFINDORs came spilling onto the field, he saw  SNAPE land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into  DUmbledore's smiling face.
"well  DONe," said  DUmbledore quietly, so that only harry could hear.
"nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..."
     SNAPE spat bitterly on the ground.
harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed.
he couldn't ever remember feeling happier.
he'd really  DONe something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more.
the evening air had never smelled so sweet.
he walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur:  GRYFFINDORs running to lift him onto their shoulders; ron and  HERMLONE in the distance, jumping up and down, ron cheering through a heavy noseb LEE_JORDANd.
harry had reached the shed.
he leaned against the  WOODen door and looked up at hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.
 GRYFFINDOR in the lead.
he'd  DONe it, he'd shown  SNAPE....
    and speaking of  SNAPE...
    a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.
clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.
harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched.
he recognized the figure's prowling walk.
 SNAPE, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off.
gliding silently over the castle he saw  SNAPE enter the forest at a run.
he followed.
the trees were so thick he couldn't see where  SNAPE had gone.
he flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices.
he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.
he climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
below, in a shadowy clearing, stood  SNAPE, but he wasn't alone.
 QUIRTELL was there, too.
harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever.
harry strained to catch what they were saying.
"... d- DON't know why you wan TED t-t-to meet here of all p-places,  SEVERUS_SNAPE..."
    "oh, i thought we'd keep this private," said  SNAPE, his voice icy.
"students aren't supposed to know about the sorcerer's stone, after all."
harry leaned forward.
 QUIRTELL was mumbling something.
 SNAPE interrup TED him.
"have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid's  YEWt?"
"b-b-but  SEVERUS_SNAPE, i --"
    "you  DON't want me as your enemy,  QUIRTELL," said  SNAPE, taking a step toward him.
"i-i  DON't know what you
    "you know perfectly well what i mean."
an owl hoo TED loudly, and harry nearly fell out of the tree.
he steadied himself in time to hear  SNAPE say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
i'm waiting."
"b-but i d-d- DON't --"
    "very well,"  SNAPE cut in.
"we'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie."
he threw his cl OAK over his head and strode out of the clearing.
it was almost dark now, but harry could see  QUIRTELL, standing quite still as though he was petrified.
"harry, where have you been?"
 HERMLONE squeaked.
"we won!
you won!
we won!"
shou TED ron, thumping harry on the back.
"and i gave  MALFOY a black e YEW, and  MR._LONGBOTTOM tried to take on  CRABBE and  GOYLE single-handed!
he's still out cold but  MADAM_POMFTEY says he'll be all right - talk about showing  SLYTHERINS!
everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party,  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens."
"never mind that now," said harry breathlessly.
"let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this...."
    he made sure peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
"so we were right, it is the sorcerer's stone, and  SNAPE's trying to force  QUIRTELL to help him get it.
he asked if he knew how to get past  FLUFFY - and he said something about  QUIRTELL's 'hocus pocuss-- i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from  FLUFFY, loads of enchantments, probably, and  QUIRTELL would have  DONe some anti-dark arts spell that  SNAPE needs to break through --"
    "so you mean the stone's only safe as long as  QUIRTELL stands up to  SNAPE?"
said  HERMLONE in alarm.
"it'll be gone by next tuesday," said ron.
chapter fourteen.
 NORBERT the norwegian ridgeback.
 QUIRTELL, however, must have been braver than they'd thought.
in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked  YEWt.
every time they passed the third-floor corridor, harry, ron, and  HERMLONE would press their ears to the door to check that  FLUFFY was still growling inside.
 SNAPE was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the stone was still safe.
whenever harry passed  QUIRTELL these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and ron had star TED telling people off for laughing at  QUIRTELL's stutter.
 HERMLONE, however, had more on her mind than the sorcerer's stone.
she had star TED drawing up study sche DUles and colorcoding all her notes.
harry and ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.
" HERMLONE, the exams are ages away."
"ten weeks,"  HERMLONE snapped.
"that's not ages, that's like a second to  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel."
"but we're not six hundred  YEWars old," ron reminded her.
"anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it a."
"what am i studying for?
are you crazy?
you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second  YEWar?
they're very important, i should have star TED studying a month ago, i  DON't know what's gotten into me...."
    unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as  HERMLONE.
they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the christmas ones.
it was hard to relax with  HERMLONE next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.
moaning and yawning, harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
"i'll never remember this," ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window.
it was the first really fine day they'd had in months.
the sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
harry, who was looking up "dittany" in one thousand magical herbs and fungi, didn't look up until he heard ron say, "hagrid!
what are you doing in the library?"
hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back.
he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
"jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.
"an' what're you lot up ter?"
he looked suddenly suspicious.
" YEWr not still lookin' for  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel, are  YEWh?"
"oh, we found out who he is ages ago," said ron impressively.
"and we know what that dog's guarding, it's a sorcerer's st --"
    "shhhh!"
hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
" DON' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with  YEWh?"
"there are a few things we wan TED to ask you, as a matter of fact," said harry, "about what's guarding the stone apart from  FLUFFY --"
    "shhhh!"
said hagrid again.
"listen - come an' see me later, i'm not promisin' i'll tell  YEWh anythin', mind, but  DON' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know.
they'll think i've told  YEWh --"
    "see you later, then," said harry.
hagrid shuffled off.
"what was he hiding behind his back?"
said  HERMLONE thoughtfully.
"do you think it had anything to do with the stone?"
"i'm going to see what section he was in," said ron, who'd had enough of working.
he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.
"dragons!"
he whispered.
"hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!
look at these: dragon species of great britain and ireland; from egg to inferno, a dragon keeper's guide."
"hagrid's always wan TED a dragon, he told me so the first time i ever met him, " said harry.
"but it's against our laws," said ron.
"dragon breeding was outlawed by the  WARLOCKs' convention of 1709, everyone knows that.
it's hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous.
you should see the burns charlie's got off wild ones in romania."
"but there aren't wild dragons in britain?"
said harry.
"of course there are," said ron.
"common welsh green and hebri DEAN_THOMAS blacks.
the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up, i can tell you.
our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who've spot TED them, to make them forget."
"so what on earths hagrid up to?"
said  HERMLONE.
when they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.
hagrid called "who is it?"
before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.
it was stifling hot inside.
even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.
hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
"so --  YEWh wan TED to ask me somethin'?"
" YEWs," said harry.
there was no point beating around the bush.
"we were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the sorcerer's stone apart from  FLUFFY."
hagrid frowned at him.
"0' course i cant, he said.
"number one, i  DON' know meself.
number two,  YEWh know too much already, so i wouldn' tell  YEWh if i could.
that stone's here for a good reason.
it was almost stolen outta  GRINGOTTS - i s'ppose  YEWh've worked that out an' all?
beats me how  YEWh even know abou'  FLUFFY."
"oh, come on, hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said  HERMLONE in a warm, flattering voice.
hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling.
"we only wondered who had  DONe the guarding, really."
 HERMLONE went on.
"we wondered who  DUmbledore had trus TED enough to help him, apart from you."
hagrid's chest swelled at these last words.
harry and ron beamed at  HERMLONE.
"well, i  DON' s'pose it could hurt ter tell  YEWh that... let's see... he borrowed  FLUFFY from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...
professor sprout -- professor  FLITWICK -- professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL --" he ticked them off on his fingers, "professor  QUIRTELL -- an'  DUmbledore himself did somethin', o' course.
hang on, i've forgotten someone.
oh  YEWah, professor  SNAPE."
" SNAPE?"
" YEWah --  YEWr not still on abou' that, are  YEWh?
look,  SNAPE helped protect the stone, he's not about ter steal it."
harry knew ron and  HERMLONE were thinking the same as he was.
if  SNAPE had been in on protecting the stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it.
he probably knew everything -- except, it seemed,  QUIRTELL's spell and how to get past  FLUFFY.
"you're the only one who knows how to get past  FLUFFY.
aren't you, hagrid?"
said harry anxiously.
"and you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?
not even one of the teachers?"
"not a soul knows except me an'  DUmbledore," said hagrid proudly.
"well, that's something," harry muttered to the others.
"hagrid, can we have a window open?
i'm boiling."
"can't, harry, sorry," said hagrid.
harry noticed him glance at the fire.
harry looked at it, too.
"hagrid -- what's that?"
but he already knew what it was.
in the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
"ah," said hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "that's er..."
    "where did you get it, hagrid?"
said ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg.
"it must've cost you a fortune."
"won it," said hagrid.
"las' night.
i was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger.
think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
"but what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?"
said  HERMLONE.
"well, i've bin doin' some readin' , said hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow.
"got this outta the library -- dragon breeding for pleasure and profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here.
keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their  MOTHERs breathe on i em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.
an' see here -- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs -- what i got there's a norwegian ridgeback.
they're rare, them."
he looked very pleased with himself, but  HERMLONE didn't.
"hagrid, you live in a  WOODen house," she said.
but hagrid wasn't listening.
he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.
so now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
"wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.
 HERMLONE had now star TED making study sche DUles for harry and ron, too.
it was driving them nuts.
then, one breakfast time,  HEDWIG brought harry another note from hagrid.
he had written only two words: it's hatching.
ron wan TED to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut.
 HERMLONE wouldn't hear of it.
" HERMLONE, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?"
"we've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --"
    "shut up!"
harry whispered.
 MALFOY was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.
how much had he heard?
harry didn't like the look on  MALFOY's face at all.
ron and  HERMLONE argued all the way to herbology and in the end,  HERMLONE agreed to run down to hagrid's with the other two  DUring morning break.
when the  CHASER_KATIE_BELL sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.
hagrid gree TED them, looking flushed and exci TED.
"it's nearly out."
he ushered them inside.
the egg was lying on the table.
there were deep cracks in it.
something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.
they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with ba TED breath.
all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.
the baby dragon flopped onto the table.
it wasn't exactly pretty; harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.
its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange e YEWs.
it sneezed.
a couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
"isn't he beautiful?"
hagrid murmured.
he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head.
it snapped at his fingers, showing poin TED  FANGs.
"bless him, look, he knows his  MOMmy!"
said hagrid.
"hagrid," said  HERMLONE, "how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow, exactly?"
hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
"what's the matter?"
"someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid -- he's runnin' back up ter the school."
harry bol TED to the door and looked out.
even at a distance there was no mistaking him.
 MALFOY had seen the dragon.
something about the smile lurking on  MALFOY's face  DUring the next week made harry, ron, and  HERMLONE very nervous.
they spent most of their free time in hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.
"just let him go," harry urged.
"set him free."
"i can't," said hagrid.
"he's too little.
he'd die."
they looked at the dragon.
it had grown three times in length in just a week.
smoke kept furling out of its nostrils.
hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping  DUties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.
there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
"i've decided to call him  NORBERT," said hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty e YEWs.
"he really knows me now, watch.
 NORBERT!
 NORBERT!
where's  MOMmy?"
"he's lost his marbles," ron muttered in harry's ear.
"hagrid," said harry loudly, "give it two weeks and  NORBERT's going to be as long as your house.
 MALFOY could go to  DUmbledore at any  MOMent."
hagrid bit his lip.
"i -- i know i can't keep him forever, but i can't jus'  DUmp him, i can't."
harry suddenly turned to ron.
charlie, he said.
"you're losing it, too," said ron.
"i'm ron, remember?"
"no -- charlie -- your brother, charlie.
in romania.
studying dragons.
we could send  NORBERT to him.
charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!"
"brilliant!"
said ron.
"how about it, hagrid?"
and in the end, hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to charlie to ask him.
the following week dragged by.
wednesday night found  HERMLONE and harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
the clock on the wall had just
    chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open.
ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry's invisibility cl OAK.
he had been down at hagrid's hut, helping him feed  NORBERT, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
"it bit me!"
he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief.
"i'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week.
i tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal i've ever met, but the way hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a  FLUFFY little bunny rabbit.
when it bit me he told me off for frightening it.
and when i left, he was singing it a lullaby."
there was a tap on the dark window.
"it's  HEDWIG!"
said harry, hurrying to let her in.
"she'll have charlie's answer!"
the three of them put their heads together to read the note.
dear ron,
    how are you?
thanks for the letter -- i'd be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here.
i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.
trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.
could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday?
they can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.
send me an answer as soon as possible.
love,
    charlie
    they looked at one another.
"we've got the invisibility cl OAK," said harry.
"it shouldn't be too difficult -- i think the cl OAKs big enough to cover two of us and  NORBERT."
it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him.
anything to get rid of  NORBERT -- and  MALFOY.
there was a hitch.
by the next morning, ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size.
he didn't know whether it was safe to go to  MADAM_POMFTEY -- would she recognize a dragon bite?
by the afternoon, though, he had no choice.
the cut had turned a nasty shade of green.
it looked as if  NORBERT's  FANGs were poisonous.
harry and  HERMLONE rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed.
"it's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's about to fall off.
 MALFOY told  MADAM_POMFTEY he wan TED to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me.
he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- i've told her it was a dog, but i  DON't think she believes me -i shouldn't have hit him at the quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."
harry and  HERMLONE tried to calm ron down.
"it'll all be over at midnight on saturday," said  HERMLONE, but this didn't soothe ron at all.
on the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.
"midnight on saturday!"
he said in a hoarse voice.
"oh no oh no -- i've just remembered -- charlie's letter was in that book  MALFOY took, he's going to know we're getting rid of  NORBERT."
harry and  HERMLONE didn't get a chance to answer.
 MADAM_POMFTEY came over at that  MOMent and made them leave, saying ron needed s LEE_JORDANp.
"it's too late to change the plan now," harry told  HERMLONE.
"we haven't got time to send charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of  NORBERT.
we'll have to risk it.
and we have got the invisibility cl OAK,  MALFOY doesn't know about that."
they found  FANG, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
"i won't let you in," he puffed.
" NORBERT's at a tricky stage -- nothin' i can't handle."
when they told him about charlie's letter, his e YEWs filled with tears, although that might have been because  NORBERT had just bitten him on the leg.
"aargh!
it's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all."
the baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.
harry and  HERMLONE walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldn't come quickly enough.
they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say good-b YEW to  NORBERT if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do.
it was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall.
hagrid had  NORBERT packed and ready in a large crate.
"he's got lots o' rats an' some brandy for the journey," said hagrid in a muffled voice.
"an' i've packed his  TEDdy bear in case he gets lonely."
from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the  TEDdy was having his head torn off.
"b YEW-b YEW,  NORBERT!"
hagrid sobbed, as harry and  HERMLONE covered the crate with the invisibility cl OAK and stepped underneath it themselves.
" MOMmy will never forget you!"
how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew.
midnight ticked nearer as they heaved  NORBERT up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
up another staircase, then another -- even one of harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.
"nearly there!"
harry pan TED as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.
forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.
a lamp flared.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had  MALFOY by the ear.
"detention!"
she shou TED.
"and twenty points from  SLYTHERINS!
wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --"
    "you  DON't understand, professor.
 HARRY_POTTER's coming -- he's got a dragon!"
"what utter rubbish!
how dare you tell such lies!
come on -- i shall see professor  SNAPE about you,  MALFOY!"
the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.
not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cl OAK, glad to be able to breathe properly again.
 HERMLONE did a sort of jig.
" MALFOY's got detention!
i could sing!"
" DON't," harry advised her.
chuckling about  MALFOY, they wai TED,  NORBERT thrashing about in his crate.
about ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.
charlie's friends were a cheery lot.
they showed harry and  HERMLONE the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend  NORBERT between them.
they all helped buckle  NORBERT safely into it and then harry and  HERMLONE shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
at last,  NORBERT was going... going... gone.
they slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that  NORBERT was off them.
no more dragon --  MALFOY in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?
the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs.
as they stepped into the corridor,  FILCH's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
"well, well, well," he whispered, "we are in trouble."
they'd left the invisibility cl OAK on top of the tower.
chapter fifteen.
the foribidden forest.
things couldn't have been worse.
 FILCH took them down to professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's study on the first floor, where they sat and wai TED without saying a word to each other.
 HERMLONE was trembling.
excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around harry's brain, each more feeble than the last.
he couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time.
they were cornered.
how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cl OAK?
there was no reason on earth that professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes.
add  NORBERT and the invisibility cl OAK, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
had harry thought that things couldn't have been worse?
he was wrong.
when professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL appeared, she was leading  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
"harry!"
 MR._LONGBOTTOM burst out, the  MOMent he saw the other two.
"i was trying to find you to warn you, i heard  MALFOY saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --"
    harry shook his head violently to shut  MR._LONGBOTTOM up, but professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had seen.
she looked more likely to breathe fire than  NORBERT as she towered over the three of them.
"i would never have believed it of any of you.
mr.  FILCH says you were up in the astronomy tower.
it's one o'clock in the morning.
explain yourselves."
it was the first time  HERMLONE had ever failed to answer a teacher's question.
she was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
"i think i've got a good idea of what's been going on," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"it doesn't take a genius to work it out.
you fed draco  MALFOY some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble.
i've already caught him.
i suppose you think it's funny that longbot TOM here heard the story and believed it, too?"
harry caught  MR._LONGBOTTOM's e YEW and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because  MR._LONGBOTTOM was looking stunned and hurt.
poor, blundering  MR._LONGBOTTOM -- harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.
"i'm disgus TED," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL.
"four students out of bed in one night!
i've never heard of such a thing before!
you, miss  GRANger, i thought you had more sense.
as for you, mr.  POTTER, i thought  GRYFFINDOR meant more to you than this.
all three of you will receive detentions --  YEWs, you too, mr. longbot TOM, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from  GRYFFINDOR."
"fifty?"
harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last quidditch match.
"fifty points each," said professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, breathing heavily through her long, poin TED nose.
"professor -- please
    "you can't --"
    " DON't tell me what i can and can't do,  POTTER.
now get back to bed, all of you.
i've never been more ashamed of  GRYFFINDOR students."
a hundred and fifty points lost.
that put  GRYFFINDOR in last place.
in one night, they'd ruined any chance  GRYFFINDOR had had for the house cup.
harry felt as though the bot TOM had dropped out of his s TOMach.
how could they ever make up for this?
harry didn't s LEE_JORDANp all night.
he could hear  MR._LONGBOTTOM sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.
harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him.
he knew  MR._LONGBOTTOM, like himself, was dreading the dawn.
what would happen when the rest of  GRYFFINDOR found out what they'd  DONe?
at first,  GRYFFINDORs passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake.
how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than  YEWsterday?
and then the story star TED to spread:  HARRY_POTTER, the famous  HARRY_POTTER, their hero of two quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first  YEWars.
from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, harry was suddenly the most ha TED.
even  RAVENCLAWs and  HUFFLEPUFFS turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see  SLYTHERINS lose the house cup.
everywhere harry went, people poin TED and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insul TED him.
 SLYTHERINS, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "thanks  POTTER, we owe you one!"
only ron stood by him.
"they'll all forget this in a few weeks.
 FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them."
"they've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?"
said harry miserably.
"well -- no," ron admit TED.
it was a bit late to repair the damage, but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on.
he'd had it with sneaking around and spying.
he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to  WOOD and offered to resign from the quidditch team.
"resign?"
 WOOD thundered.
"what good'll that do?
how are we going to get any points back if we can't win at quidditch?"
but even quidditch had lost its fun.
the rest of the team wouldn't speak to harry  DUring practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the seeker."
 HERMLONE and  MR._LONGBOTTOM were suffering, too.
they didn't have as bad a time as harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either.
 HERMLONE had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away.
all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery.
he, ron, and  HERMLONE kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the in GREDients in complica TED potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin re CHASER_KATIE_BELLions....
    then, about a week before the exams were  DUe to start, harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpec TED test.
walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead.
as he drew closer, he heard  QUIRTELL's voice.
"no -- no -- not again, please --"
    it sounded as though someone was threatening him.
harry moved closer.
"all right -- all right --" he heard  QUIRTELL sob.
next second,  QUIRTELL came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban.
he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry.
he strode out of sight; harry didn't think  QUIRTELL had even noticed him.
he wai TED until  QUIRTELL's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom.
it was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.
harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.
all the same, he'd have gambled twelve sorcerer's stones that  SNAPE had just left the room, and from what harry had just heard,  SNAPE would be walking with a new spring in his step --  QUIRTELL seemed to have given in at last.
harry went back to the library, where  HERMLONE was testing ron on astronomy.
harry told them what he'd heard.
" SNAPE's  DONe it, then!"
said ron.
"if  QUIRTELL's told him how to break his anti-dark force spell --"
    "there's still  FLUFFY, though," said  HERMLONE.
"maybe  SNAPE's found out how to get past him without asking hagrid," said ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them.
"i bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog.
so what do we do, harry?"
the light of adventure was kindling again in ron's e YEWs, but  HERMLONE answered before harry could.
"go to  DUmbledore.
that's what we should have  DONe ages ago.
if we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
"but we've got no proof!"
said harry.
" QUIRTELL's too scared to back us up.
 SNAPE's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they'll believe, him or us?
it's not exactly a secret we hate him,  DUmbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked.
 FILCH wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with  SNAPE, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think.
and  DON't forget, we're not supposed to know about the stone or  FLUFFY.
that'll take a lot of explaining."
 HERMLONE looked convinced, but ron didn't.
"if we just do a bit of poking around --"
    "no," said harry flatly, "we've  DONe enough poking around."
he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and star TED to learn the names of its moons.
the following morning, notes were delivered to harry,  HERMLONE, and  MR._LONGBOTTOM at the breakfast table.
they were all the same:
    your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight.
meet mr.  FILCH in the entrance hall.
harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost.
he half expec TED  HERMLONE to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word.
like harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.
at eleven o'clock that night, they said good-b YEW to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
 FILCH was already there -- and so was  MALFOY.
harry had also forgotten that  MALFOY had gotten a detention, too.
"follow me," said  FILCH, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
i bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?"
he said,  LEE_JORDANring at them.
"oh  YEWs... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me....
it's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, i've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed....
right, off we go, and  DON't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do."
they marched off across the dark grounds.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM kept sniffing.
harry wondered what their punishment was going to be.
it must be something really horrible, or  FILCH wouldn't be sounding so deligh TED.
the moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness.
ahead, harry could see the ligh TED windows of hagrid's hut.
then they heard a distant shout.
"is that you,  FILCH?
hurry up, i want ter get star TED."
harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn't be so bad.
his relief must have showed in his -face, because  FILCH said, "i suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf?
well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and i'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
at this,  MR._LONGBOTTOM let out a little moan, and  MALFOY stopped dead in his tracks.
"the forest?"
he repea TED, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual.
"we can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, i heard."
 MR._LONGBOTTOM clutched the s LEE_JORDANve of harry's robe and made a choking noise.
"that's your problem, isn't it?"
said  FILCH, his voice cracking with g LEE_JORDAN.
"should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?"
hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark,  FANG at his heel.
he was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.
"abou' time," he said.
"i bin waitin' for half an hour already.
all right, harry,  HERMLONE?"
"i shouldn't be too friendly to them, hagrid," said  FILCH coldly, they're here to be punished, after all."
"that's why  YEWr late, is it?"
said hagrid, frowning at  FILCH.
"bin lecturin' them, eh?
'snot your place ter do that.
 YEWh've  DONe  YEWr bit, i'll take over from here."
"i'll be back at dawn," said  FILCH, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and star TED back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
 MALFOY now turned to hagrid.
"i'm not going in that forest, he said, and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.
" YEWh are if  YEWh want ter stay at hogwarts," said hagrid fiercely.
" YEWh've  DONe wrong an' now  YEWhve got ter pay for it."
"but this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do.
i thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew i was doing this, he'd
    tell  YEWr that's how it is at hogwarts," hagrid growled.
"copyin' lines!
what good's that ter anyone?
 YEWh'll do summat useful or  YEWh'll get out.
if  YEWh think  YEWr father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack.
go on"'
     MALFOY didn't move.
he looked at hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.
"right then," said hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' i  DON' want no one takin' risks.
follow me over here a  MOMent."
he led them to the very edge of the forest.
holding his lamp up high, he poin TED down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees.
a light breeze lif TED their hair as they looked into the forest.
"look there," said hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
silvery stuff?
that's unicorn blood.
there's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.
this is the second time in a week.
i found one dead last wednesday.
we're gonna try an' find the poor thing.
we might have ter put it out of its misery."
"and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?"
said  MALFOY, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.
"there's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt  YEWh if  YEWr with me or  FANG," said hagrid.
"an' keep ter the path.
right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions.
there's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least."
"i want  FANG," said  MALFOY quickly, looking at  FANG's long teeth.
"all right, but i warn  YEWh, he's a coward," said hagrid. "
so me, harry, an'  HERMLONE'll go one way an' draco,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, an'  FANG'll go the other.
now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?
get  YEWr wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find  YEWh -- so, be careful -- let's go."
the forest was black and silent.
a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and harry,  HERMLONE, and hagrid took the left path while  MALFOY,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, and  FANG took the right.
they walked in silence, their e YEWs on the ground.
every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.
harry saw that hagrid looked very worried.
"could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?"
harry asked.
"not fast enough," said hagrid.
"it's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures.
i never knew one ter be hurt before."
they walked past a mossy tree stump.
harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by.
there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
"you all right,  HERMLONE?"
hagrid whispered.
" DON' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- get behind that tree!"
hagrid seized harry and  HERMLONE and hois TED them off the path behind a towering  OAK.
he pulled out an arrow and fit TED it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire.
the three of them listened.
something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cl OAK trailing along the ground.
hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.
"i knew it, " he murmured.
"there's summat in here that shouldn' be."
"a werewolf?"
harry sugges TED.
"that wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said hagrid grimly.
"right, follow me, but careful, now."
they walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
"who's there?"
hagrid called.
"show  YEWrself -- i'm armed!"
and into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse?
to the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail.
harry and  HERMLONE's jaws dropped.
"oh, it's you,  RONAN," said hagrid in relief.
"how are  YEWh?"
he walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.
"good evening to you, hagrid," said  RONAN.
he had a deep, sorrowful voice.
"were you going to shoot me?"
"can't be too careful,  RONAN," said hagrid, patting his crossbow.
"there's summat bad loose in this forest.
this is  HARRY_POTTER an'  HERMIONE_GRANGER, by the way.
students up at the school.
an' this is  RONAN, you two.
he's a centaur.))
"we'd noticed," said  HERMLONE faintly.
"good evening," said  RONAN.
"students, are you?
and do you learn much, up at the school?"
"erm --"
    "a bit," said  HERMLONE timidly.
"a bit.
well, that's something."
 RONAN sighed.
he flung back his head and stared at the sky.
"mars is bright tonight."
" YEWah," said hagrid, glancing up, too.
"listen, i'm glad we've run inter  YEWh,  RONAN, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
 RONAN didn't answer immediately.
he stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.
"always the innocent are the first victims," he said.
"so it has been for ages past, so it is now."
" YEWah," said hagrid, "but have  YEWh seen anythin',  RONAN?
anythin' unusual?"
"mars is bright tonight,"  RONAN repea TED, while hagrid watched him impatiently.
"unusually bright."
" YEWah, but i was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said hagrid.
"so  YEWh haven't noticed anythin' strange?"
 YEWt again,  RONAN took a while to answer.
at last, he said, "the forest hides many secrets."
a movement in the trees behind  RONAN made hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than  RONAN.
"hullo,  BANE," said hagrid.
"all right?"
"good evening, hagrid, i hope you are well?"
"well enough.
look, i've jus' bin askin'  RONAN, you seen anythin' odd in here lately?
there's a unicorn bin injured -- would  YEWh know anythin' about it?"
 BANE walked over to stand next to  RONAN.
he looked skyward.
"mars is bright tonight," he said simply.
"we've heard," said hagrid grumpily.
"well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't  YEWh?
we'll be off, then."
harry and  HERMLONE followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at  RONAN and  BANE until the trees blocked their view.
"never," said hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur.
ruddy stargazers.
not interes TED in anythin' closer'n the moon."
"are there many of them in here?"
asked  HERMLONE.
"oh, a fair few... keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever i want a word.
they're deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus'  DON' let on much."
"d'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?"
said harry.
"did that sound like hooves to you?
nah, if  YEWh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before."
they walked on through the dense, dark trees.
harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder.
he had the nasty feeling they were being watched.
he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them.
they had just passed a bend in the path when  HERMLONE grabbed hagrid's arm.
"hagrid!
look!
red sparks, the others are in trouble!"
"you two wait here!"
hagrid shou TED.
"stay on the path, i'll come back for  YEWh!"
they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.
"you  DON't think they've been hurt, do you?"
whispered  HERMLONE.
"i  DON't care if  MALFOY has, but if something's got  MR._LONGBOTTOM... it's our fault he's here in the first place."
the minutes dragged by.
their ears seemed sharper than usual.
harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.
what was going on?
where were the others?
at last, a great crunching noise announced hagrid's return.
 MALFOY,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, and  FANG were with him.
hagrid was fuming.
 MALFOY, it seemed, had sneaked up behind  MR._LONGBOTTOM and grabbed him as a joke.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM had pa NICKed and sent up the sparks.
"we'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'.
right, we're changin' groups --  MR._LONGBOTTOM, you stay with me an'  HERMLONE, harry, you go with  FANG an' this idiot.
i'm sorry," hagrid added in a whisper to harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this  DONe."
so harry set off into the heart of the forest with  MALFOY and  FANG.
they walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick.
harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.
there were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.
harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient  OAK.
"look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop  MALFOY.
something bright white was gleaming on the ground.
they inched closer.
it was the unicorn all right, and it was dead.
harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad.
its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood.
a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.
harry,  MALFOY, and  FANG stood transfixed.
the cl OAKed figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
"aaaaaaaaaargh!"
 MALFOY let out a terrible scream and bol TED -- so did  FANG.
the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front.
it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry -- he couldn't move for fear.
then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire.
half blinded, he staggered backward.
he heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over harry, charging at the figure.
the pain in harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees.
it took a minute or two to pass.
when he looked up, the figure had gone.
a centaur was standing over him, not  RONAN or  BANE; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
"are you all right?"
said the centaur, pulling harry to his feet.
" YEWs -- thank you -- what was that?"
the centaur didn't answer.
he had astonishingly blue e YEWs, like pale sapphires.
he looked carefully at harry, his e YEWs lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on harry's forehead.
"you are the  POTTER boy," he said.
"you had better get back to hagrid.
the forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you.
can you ride?
it will be quicker this way.
"my name is  FIRENZE," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back.
there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing.
 RONAN and  BANE came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.
" FIRENZE!"
 BANE thundered.
"what are you doing?
you have a human on your back!
have you no shame?
are you a common mule?"
"do you realize who this is?"
said  FIRENZE.
"this is the  POTTER boy.
the quicker he leaves this forest, the better."
"what have you been telling him?"
growled  BANE.
"remember,  FIRENZE, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens.
have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
 RONAN pawed the ground nervously.
"i'm sure  FIRENZE thought he was acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.
 BANE kicked his back legs in anger.
"for the best!
what is that to do with us?
centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold!
it is not our business to run around like  DONkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
 FIRENZE suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
"do you not see that unicorn?"
 FIRENZE  CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed at  BANE.
"do you not understand why it was killed?
or have the planets not let you in on that secret?
i set myself against what is lurking in this forest,  BANE,  YEWs, with humans alongside me if i must."
and  FIRENZE whisked around; with harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving  RONAN and  BANE behind them.
harry didn't have a clue what was going on.
"why's  BANE so angry?"
he asked.
"what was that thing you saved me from, anyway?"
 FIRENZE slowed to a walk, warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer harry's question.
they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought  FIRENZE didn't want to talk to him anymore.
they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when  FIRENZE suddenly stopped.
" HARRY_POTTER, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?"
"no," said harry, startled by the odd question.
"we've only used the horn and tail hair in potions."
"that is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said  FIRENZE.
"only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.
the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.
you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the  MOMent the blood touches your lips."
harry stared at the back of  FIRENZE's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.
"but who'd be that desperate?"
he wondered aloud.
"if you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"
"it is,"  FIRENZE agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.
mr.  POTTER, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very  MOMent?"
"the sorcerer's stone!
of course -- the elixir of life!
but i  DON't understand who --"
    "can you think of nobody who has wai TED many  YEWars to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry's heart.
over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "some say he died.
codswallop, in my opinion.
 DUnno if he had enough human left in him to die."
"do you mean," harry cr OAKed, "that was vol-"
    "harry!
harry, are you all right?"
 HERMLONE was running toward them down the path, hagrid puffing along behind her.
"i'm fine," said harry, hardly knowing what he was saying.
"the unicorn's dead, hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
"this is where i leave you,"  FIRENZE murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.
"you are safe now."
harry slid off his back.
"good luck,  HARRY_POTTER," said  FIRENZE.
"the planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.
i hope this is one of those times."
he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving harry shivering behind him.
ron had fallen as LEE_JORDANp in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.
he shou TED something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake.
in a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-e YEWd as harry began to tell him and  HERMLONE what had happened in the forest.
harry couldn't sit down.
he paced up and down in front of the fire.
he was still shaking.
" SNAPE wants the stone for  VOLDEMORT... and  VOLDEMORT's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought  SNAPE just wan TED to get rich...."
    "stop saying the name!"
said ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought  VOLDEMORT could hear them.
harry wasn't listening.
" FIRENZE saved me, but he shouldn't have  DONe so....  BANE was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen....
they must show that  VOLDEMORT's coming back....  BANE thinks  FIRENZE should have let  VOLDEMORT kill me....
i suppose that's written in the stars as well."
"will you stop saying the name!"
ron hissed.
"so all i've got to wait for now is  SNAPE to steal the stone," harry went on feverishly, "then  VOLDEMORT will be able to come and finish me off... well, i suppose  BANE'll be happy."
 HERMLONE looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
"harry, everyone says  DUmbledore's the only one  YOU-KNOW-who was ever afraid of with  DUmbledore around,  YOU-KNOW-who won't touch you.
anyway, who says the centaurs are right?
it sounds like fortune-telling to me, and professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."
the sky had turned light before they stopped talking.
they went to bed exhaus TED, their throats sore.
but the night's surprises weren't over.
when harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cl OAK folded neatly underneath them.
there was a note pinned to it:
    just in case.
chapter sixteen.
through the trapdoor.
in  YEWars to come, harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expec TED  VOLDEMORT to come bursting through the door at any  MOMent.
 YEWt the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that  FLUFFY was still alive and well behind the locked door.
it was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers.
they had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell.
they had practical exams as well.
professor  FLITWICK called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.
 SNAPE made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion.
harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldn't s LEE_JORDANp, but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
maybe it was because they hadn't seen what harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but ron and  HERMLONE didn't seem as worried about the stone as harry.
the idea of  VOLDEMORT certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what  SNAPE or anyone else might be up to.
their very last exam was history of magic.
one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd inven TED selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out.
when the ghost of professor  BINNS told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.
"that was far easier than i thought it would be," said  HERMLONE as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.
"i needn't have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of con DUct or the uprising of elfric the eager."
 HERMLONE always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree.
the weasley twins and  LEE_JORDAN were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.
"no more studying," ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.
"you could look more cheerful, harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've  DONe, there's no need to worry  YEWt."
harry was rubbing his forehead.
"i wish i knew what this means!"
he burst out angrily.
"my scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."
"go to  MADAM_POMFTEY,"  HERMLONE sugges TED.
"i'm not ill," said harry.
"i think it's a warning... it means danger's coming...."
    ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
"harry, relax,  HERMLONE's right, the stone's safe as long as  DUmbledore's around.
anyway, we've never had any proof  SNAPE found out how to get past  FLUFFY.
he nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry.
and  MR._LONGBOTTOM will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets  DUmbledore down."
harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important.
when he tried to explain this,  HERMLONE said, "that's just the exams.
i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we'd  DONe that one."
harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though.
he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.
hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters.
hagrid would never betray  DUmbledore.
hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past  FLUFFY... never... but --
    harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
"where're you going?"
said ron s LEE_JORDANpily.
"i've just thought of something," said harry.
he had turned white.
"we've got to go and see hagrid, now."
"why?"
pan TED  HERMLONE, hurrying to keep up.
" DON't you think it's a bit odd," said harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, "that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?
how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?
lucky they found hagrid,  DON't you think?
why didn't i see it before?"
"what are you talking about?"
said ron, but harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.
hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and s LEE_JORDANves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.
"hullo," he said, smiling.
"finished  YEWr exams?
got time fer a drink?"
" YEWs, please," said ron, but harry cut him off.
"no, we're in a hurry.
hagrid, i've got to ask you something.
you know that night you won  NORBERT?
what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?"
" DUnno," said hagrid casually, "he wouldn' take his cl OAK off."
he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his e YEWbrows.
"it's not that unusual,  YEWh get a lot o' funny folk in the hog's head -- that's the pub down in the village.
mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he?
i never saw his face, he kept his hood up."
harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
"what did you talk to him about, hagrid?
did you mention hogwarts at all?"
"mighta come up," said hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
" YEWah... he asked what i did, an' i told him i was gamekeeper here....
he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after... so i told him... an' i said what i'd always really wan TED was a dragon... an' then...
i can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.... let's see...  YEWah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards for it if i wan TED... but he had ter be sure i could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home....
so i told him, after  FLUFFY, a dragon would be easy..."
    "and did he -- did he seem interes TED in  FLUFFY?"
harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.
"well --  YEWah -- how many three-headed dogs d' YEWh meet, even around hogwarts?
so i told him,  FLUFFY's a piece o' cake if  YEWh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter s LEE_JORDANp --"
    hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
"i shouldn'ta told  YEWh that!"
he blur TED out.
"forget i said it!
hey -- where're  YEWh goin'?"
harry, ron, and  HERMLONE didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.
"we've got to go to  DUmbledore," said harry.
"hagrid told that stranger how to get past  FLUFFY, and it was either  SNAPE or  VOLDEMORT under that cl OAK -- it must've been easy, once he'd got hagrid drunk.
i just hope  DUmbledore believes us.
 FIRENZE might back us up if  BANE doesn't stop him.
where's  DUmbledore's office?"
they looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction.
they had never been told where  DUmbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
"we'll just have to --" harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.
"what are you three doing inside?"
it was professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL, carrying a large pile of books.
"we want to see professor  DUmbledore," said  HERMLONE, rather bravely, harry and ron thought.
"see professor  DUmbledore?"
professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL repea TED, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do.
"why?"
harry swallowed -- now what?
"it's sort of secret," he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's nostrils flared.
"professor  DUmbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly.
"he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for lon DON at once."
"he's gone?"
said harry frantically.
"now?"
"professor  DUmbledore is a very great wizard,  POTTER, he has many demands on his time --
    "but this is important."
"something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic,  POTTER.
"look," said harry, throwing caution to the winds, "professor -- it's about the sorcerer's tone --"
    whatever professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL had expec TED, it wasn't that.
the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.
"how do you know --?"
she spluttered.
"professor, i think -- i know -- that sn- that someone's going to try and steal the stone.
i've got to talk to professor  DUmbledore."
she e YEWd him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
"professor  DUmbledore will be back  TOMorrow," she said finally.
i  DON't know how you found out about the stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protec TED."
"but professor --"
    " POTTER, i know what i'm talking about," she said shortly.
she bent down and gathered up the fallen books.
i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine."
but they didn't.
"it's tonight," said harry, once he was sure professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL was out of earshot.
" SNAPE's going through the trapdoor tonight.
he's found out everything he needs, and now he's got  DUmbledore out of the way.
he sent that note, i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when  DUmbledore turns up."
"but what can we --"
     HERMLONE gasped.
harry and ron wheeled round.
 SNAPE was standing there.
"good afternoon," he said smoothly.
they stared at him.
"you shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd, twis TED smile.
"we were --" harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.
"you want to be more careful," said  SNAPE.
"hanging around
    like this, people will think you're up to something.
and  GRYFFINDOR really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?"
harry flushed.
they turned to go outside, but  SNAPE called them back.
"be warned,  POTTER -- any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled.
good day to you."
he strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
out on the stone steps, harry turned to the others.
"right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered urgently.
"one of us has got to keep an e YEW on  SNAPE -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it.
 HERMLONE, you'd better do that."
"why me?"
"it's obvious," said ron.
"you can pretend to be waiting for professor  FLITWICK, you know."
he put on a high voice, "'oh professor  FLITWICK, i'm so worried, i think i got question fourteen b wrong....'"
    "oh, shut up," said  HERMLONE, but she agreed to go and watch out for  SNAPE.
"and we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," harry told ron.
"come on."
but that part of the plan didn't work.
no sooner had they reached the door separating  FLUFFY from the rest of the school than professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
"i suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!"
she stormed.
"enough of this nonsense!
if i hear you 've come anywhere near here again, i'll take another fifty points from  GRYFFINDOR!
 YEWs, weasley, from my own house!"
harry and ron went back to the common room, harry had just said, "at least  HERMLONE's on  SNAPE's tail," when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and  HERMLONE came in.
"i'm sorry, harry!"
she wailed.
" SNAPE came out and asked me what i was doing, so i said i was waiting for  FLITWICK, and  SNAPE went to get him, and i've only just got away, i  DON't know where  SNAPE went."
"well, that's it then, isn't it?"
harry said.
the other two stared at him.
he was pale and his e YEWs were glittering.
"i'm going out of here tonight and i'm going to try and get to the stone first."
"you're mad!"
said ron.
"you can't!"
said  HERMLONE.
"after what  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL and  SNAPE have said?
you'll be expelled!"
"so whap" harry shou TED.
" DON't you understand?
if  SNAPE gets hold of the stone,  VOLDEMORT's coming back!
haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?
there won't be any hogwarts to get expelled from!
he'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the dark arts!
losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see?
d'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if  GRYFFINDOR wins the house cup?
if i get caught before i can get to the stone, well, i'll have to go back to the  DURSLEYS and wait for  VOLDEMORT to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than i would have, because i'm never going over to the dark side!
i'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!
 VOLDEMORT killed my parents, remember?"
he glared at them.
"you're right harry," said  HERMLONE in a small voice.
"i'll use the invisibility cl OAK," said harry.
"it's just lucky i got it back."
"but will it cover all three of us?"
said ron.
"all -- all three of us?"
"oh, come off it, you  DON't think we'd let you go alone?"
"of course not," said  HERMLONE briskly.
"how do you think you'd get to the stone without us?
i'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful..."
    "but if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too."
"not if i can help it," said  HERMLONE grimly.
" FLITWICK told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam.
they're not throwing me out after that."
after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.
nobody bothered them; none of the  GRYFFINDORs had anything to say to harry any more, after all.
this was the first night he hadn't been upset by it.
 HERMLONE was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break.
harry and ron didn't talk much.
both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.
slowly, the room emptied as people drif TED off to bed.
"better get the cl OAK," ron muttered, as  LEE_JORDAN finally left, stretching and yawning.
harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.
he put TED out the cl OAK and then his e YEWs fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas.
he pocke TED it to use on  FLUFFY -- he didn't feel much like singing.
he ran back down to the common room.
"we'd better put the cl OAK on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if  FILCH spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --"
    "what are you doing?"
said a voice from the corner of the room.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM appeared from behind an armchair, clutching  TREVOR the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.
"nothing,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, nothing," said harry, hurriedly putting the cl OAK behind his back.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM stared at their guilty faces.
"you're going out again," he said.
"no, no, no," said  HERMLONE.
"no, we're not.
why  DON't you go to bed,  MR._LONGBOTTOM?"
harry looked at the  GRANdfather clock by the door.
they couldn't afford to waste any more time,  SNAPE might even now be playing  FLUFFY to s LEE_JORDANp.
"you can't go out," said  MR._LONGBOTTOM, "you'll be caught again.
 GRYFFINDOR will be in even more trouble."
"you  DON't understand," said harry, "this is important."
but  MR._LONGBOTTOM was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.
i won't let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole.
"i'll -- i'll fight you!"
" MR._LONGBOTTOM, "ron exploded, "get away from that hole and  DON't be an idiot --"
    " DON't you call me an idiot!"
said  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
i  DON't think you should be breaking any more rules!
and you were the one who told me to stand up to people!"
" YEWs, but not to us," said ron in exasperation.
" MR._LONGBOTTOM, you  DON't know what you're doing."
he took a step forward and  MR._LONGBOTTOM dropped  TREVOR the toad, who leapt out of sight.
"go on then, try and hit me!"
said  MR._LONGBOTTOM, raising his fists.
"i'm ready!"
harry turned to  HERMLONE.
"do something," he said desperately.
 HERMLONE stepped forward.
" MR._LONGBOTTOM," she said, "i'm really, really sorry about this."
she raised her wand.
"petrificus totalus!"
she cried, pointing it at  MR._LONGBOTTOM.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM's arms snapped to his sides.
his legs sprang together.
his whole body rigid, he swa YEWd where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.
 HERMLONE ran to turn him over.
 MR._LONGBOTTOM's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak.
only his e YEWs were moving, looking at them in horror.
"what've you  DONe to him?"
harry whispered.
"it's the full body-bind," said  HERMLONE miserably.
"oh,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, i'm so sorry."
"we had to,  MR._LONGBOTTOM, no time to explain," said harry.
"you'll understand later,  MR._LONGBOTTOM," said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cl OAK.
but leaving  MR._LONGBOTTOM lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen.
in their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like  FILCH, every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them.
at the foot of the first set of stairs, they spot TED mrs.  NORRIS skulking near the top.
"oh, let's kick her, just this once," ron whispered in harry's ear, but harry shook his head.
as they climbed carefully around her, mrs.  NORRIS turned her lamplike e YEWs on them, but didn't do anything.
they didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor.
peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.
"who's there?"
he said suddenly as they climbed toward him.
he narrowed his wicked black e YEWs.
"know you're there, even if i can't see you.
are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
he rose up in the air and floa TED there, squinting at them.
"should call  FILCH, i should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
harry had a sudden idea.
"peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the bloody  BARON has his own reasons for being invisible."
peeves almost fell out of the air in shock.
he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
"so sorry, your bloodiness, mr.  BARON, sir," he said greasily.
"my mistake, my mistake -- i didn't see you -- of course i didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old  PEEVSIE his little joke, sir."
"i have business here, peeves," cr OAKed harry.
"stay away from this place tonight."
"i will, sir, i most certainly will," said peeves, rising up in the air again.
"hope your business goes well,  BARON, i'll not bother you."
and he scoo TED off
    "brilliant, harry!"
whispered ron.
a few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar.
"well, there you are," harry said quietly, " SNAPE's already got past  FLUFFY."
seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.
underneath the cl OAK, harry turned to the other two.
"if you want to go back, i won't blame you," he said.
"you can take the cl OAK, i won't need it now."
" DON't be stupid," said ron.
"we're coming," said  HERMLONE.
harry pushed the door open.
as the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears.
all three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.
"what's that at its feet?"
 HERMLONE whispered.
"looks like a harp," said ron.
" SNAPE must have left it there."
"it must wake up the  MOMent you stop playing," said harry.
"well, here goes..."
    he put hagrid's flute to his lips and blew.
it wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's e YEWs began to droop.
harry hardly drew breath.
slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its  PAWS and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast as LEE_JORDANp.
"keep playing," ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cl OAK and crept toward the trapdoor.
they could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.
"i think we'll be able to pull the door open," said ron, peering over the dog's back.
"want to go first,  HERMLONE?"
"no, i  DON't!"
"all right."
ron grit TED his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs.
he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
"what can you see?"
 HERMLONE said anxiously.
"nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop."
harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at ron to get his attention and poin TED at himself.
"you want to go first?
are you sure?"
said ron.
"i  DON't know how deep this thing goes.
give the flute to  HERMLONE so she can keep him as LEE_JORDANp."
harry handed the flute over.
in the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the  MOMent  HERMLONE began to play, it fell back into its deep s LEE_JORDANp.
harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor.
there was no sign of the bot TOM.
he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips.
then he looked up at ron and said, "if anything happens to me,  DON't follow.
go straight to the owlery and send  HEDWIG to  DUmbledore, right?"
"right," said ron.
"see you in a minute, i hope...
    and harry let go.
cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- flump.
with a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft.
he sat up and felt around, his e YEWs not used to the gloom.
it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
"it's okay!"
he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
ron followed right away.
he landed, sprawled next to harry.
"what's this stuff?"
were his first words.
" DUnno, some sort of plant thing.
i suppose it's here to break the fall.
come on,  HERMLONE!"
the distant music stopped.
there was a loud bark from the dog, but  HERMLONE had already jumped.
she landed on harry's other side.
"we must be miles under the school , she said.
"lucky this plant thing's here, really," said ron.
"lucky!"
shrieked  HERMLONE.
"look at you both!"
she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall.
she had to struggle because the  MOMent she had landed, the plant had star TED to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles.
as for harry and ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
 HERMLONE had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her.
now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.
"stop moving!"
 HERMLONE ordered them.
"i know what this is -- it's  DEVIL's snare!"
"oh, i'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.
"shut up, i'm trying to remember how to kill it!"
said  HERMLONE.
"well, hurry up, i can't breathe!"
harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.
" DEVIL's snare,  DEVIL's snare... what did professor sprout say?
-- it likes the dark and the damp
    "so light a fire!"
harry choked.
" YEWs -- of course -- but there's no  WOOD!"
 HERMLONE cried, wringing her hands.
"have you gone mad?"
ron  CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed.
"are you a witch or not?"
"oh, right!"
said  HERMLONE, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same blue CHASER_KATIE_BELL flames she had used on  SNAPE at the plant.
in a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.
wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.
"lucky you pay attention in herbology,  HERMLONE," said harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
" YEWah," said ron, "and lucky harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no  WOOD,' honestly."
"this way," said harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.
all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls.
the passageway sloped downward, and harry was reminded of  GRINGOTTS.
with an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank.
if they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon --  NORBERT had been bad enough...
    "can you hear something?"
ron whispered.
harry listened.
a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.
"do you think it's a ghost?"
"i  DON't know... sounds like wings to me."
"there's light ahead -- i can see something moving."
they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them.
it was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room.
on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy  WOODen door.
"do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?"
said ron.
"probably," said harry.
"they  DON't look very vicious, but i suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice...
i'll run."
he took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprin TED across the room.
he expec TED to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened.
he reached the door untouched.
he pulled the handle, but it was locked.
the other two followed him.
they tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when  HERMLONE tried her alohomora charm.
"now what?"
said ron.
"these birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said  HERMLONE.
they watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?
"they're not birds!"
harry said suddenly.
"they're keys!
winged keys -- look carefully.
so that must mean..." he looked around the chamber while the other two squin TED up at the flock of keys.
"...  YEWs -- look!
broomsticks!
we've got to catch the key to the door!"
"but there are hundreds of them!"
ron examined the lock on the door.
"we're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle."
they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys.
they grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys dar TED and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.
not for nothing, though, was harry the youngest seeker in a century.
he had a knack for spotting things other people didn't.
after a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
"that one!"
he called to the others.
"that big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
"we've got to close in on it!"
harry called, not taking his e YEWs off the key with the damaged wing.
"ron, you come at it from above --  HERMLONE, stay below and stop it from going down and i'll try and catch it.
right, now!"
ron dived,  HERMLONE rocke TED upward, the key dodged them both, and harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.
ron and  HERMLONE's cheers echoed around the high chamber.
they landed quickly, and harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.
he rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked.
the  MOMent the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.
"ready?"
harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.
they nodded.
he pulled the door open.
the next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all.
but as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone.
facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces.
harry, ron and  HERMLONE shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.
"now what do we do?"
harry whispered.
"it's obvious, isn't it?"
said ron.
"we've got to play our way across the room."
behind the white pieces they could see another door.
"how?"
said  HERMLONE nervously.
"i think," said ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen."
he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse.
at once, the stone sprang to life.
the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helme TED head to look down at ron.
"do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?"
the black knight nodded.
ron turned to the other two.
"this needs thinking about he said.
i suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...."
    harry and  HERMLONE sta YEWd quiet, watching ron think.
finally he said, "now,  DON't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --"
    "we're not offended," said harry quickly.
"just tell us what to do."
"well, harry, you take the place of that bishop, and  HERMLONE, you 90 next to him instead of that castle."
"what about you?"
"i'm going to be a knight," said ron.
the chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that harry, ron, and  HERMLONE took.
"white always plays first in chess," said ron, peering across the board.
" YEWs... look..."
    a white pawn had moved forward two squares.
ron star TED to direct the black pieces.
they moved silently wherever he sent them.
harry's knees were trembling.
what if they lost?
"harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right."
their first real shock came when their other knight was taken.
the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.
"had to let that happen," said ron, looking shaken.
"leaves you free to take that bishop,  HERMLONE, go on."
every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
soon there was a huddle of limp black pla YEWrs slumped along the wall.
twice, ron only just noticed in time that harry and  HERMLONE were in danger.
he himself dar TED around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.
"we're nearly there," he muttered suddenly.
"let me think let me think..."
    the white queen turned her blank face toward him.
" YEWs..." said ron softly, "it's the only way...
i've got to be taken."
"nof harry and  HERMLONE shou TED.
"that's chess!"
snapped ron.
"you've got to make some sacrifices!
i take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, harry!"
"but --"
    "do you want to stop  SNAPE or not?"
"ron --"
    "look, if you  DON't hurry up, he'll already have the stone!"
there was no alternative.
"ready?"
ron called, his face pale but determined.
"here i go - now,  DON't hang around once you've won."
he stepped forward, and the white queen pounced.
she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -  HERMLONE screamed but sta YEWd on her square - the white queen dragged ron to one side.
he looked as if he'd been knocked out.
shaking, harry moved three spaces to the left.
the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry's feet.
they had won.
the chessmen par TED and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear.
with one last desperate look back at ron, harry and  HERMLONE charged through the door and up the next passageway.
"what if he's --?"
"he'll be all right," said harry, trying to convince himself.
"what do you reckon's next?"
"we've had sprout's, that was the  DEVIL's snare;  FLITWICK must've put charms on the keys;  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves  QUIRTELL's spell, and  SNAPE's."
they had reached another door.
"all right?"
harry whispered.
"go on."
harry pushed it open.
a disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses.
e YEWs watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.
"i'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs.
"come on, i can't breathe."
he pulled open the  NEXT_DOOR, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
" SNAPE's," said harry.
"what do we have to do?"
they stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway.
it wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple.
at the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.
they were trapped.
"look!"
 HERMLONE seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
harry looked over her shoulder to read it:
    danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
    two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
    one among us seven will let you move ahead,
    another will transport the drinker back instead,
    two among our number hold only nettle wine,
    three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
    to help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
    first, however slyly the poison tries to hide
    you will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
    second, different are those who stand at either end,
    but if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
    third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
    neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
    fourth, the second left and the second on the right
    are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
 HERMLONE let out a great sigh and harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
"brilliant," said  HERMLONE.
"this isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
a lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever."
"but so will we, won't we?"
"of course not," said  HERMLONE.
"everything we need is here on this paper.
seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple."
"but how do we know which to drink?"
"give me a minute."
 HERMLONE read the paper several times.
then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them.
at last, she clapped her hands.
"got it," she said.
"the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the stone."
harry looked at the tiny bottle.
"there's only enough there for one of us," he said.
"that's hardly one swallow."
they looked at each other.
"which one will get you back through the purple flames?"
 HERMLONE poin TED at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
"you drink that," said harry.
"no, listen, get back and get ron.
grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past  FLUFFY -- go straight to the owlery and send  HEDWIG to  DUmbledore, we need him.
i might be able to hold  SNAPE off for a while, but i'm no match for him, really."
"but harry -- what if  YOU-KNOW-who's with him?"
"well -- i was lucky once, wasn't i?"
said harry, pointing at his scar.
"i might get lucky again."
 HERMLONE's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him.
" HERMLONE!"
"harry -- you're a great wizard, you know."
"i'm not as good as you," said harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.
"me!"
said  HERMLONE.
"books!
and cleverness!
there are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh harry -- be careful!"
"you drink first," said harry.
"you are sure which is which, aren't you?"
"positive," said  HERMLONE.
she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.
"it's not poison?"
said harry anxiously.
"no -- but it's like ice."
"quick, go, before it wears off."
"good luck -- take care."
"go!"
 HERMLONE turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle.
he turned to face the black flames.
"here i come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.
it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body.
he put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a  MOMent he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
there was already someone there -- but it wasn't  SNAPE.
it wasn't even  VOLDEMORT.
chapter seventeen.
the man with two faces.
it was  QUIRTELL.
"you!"
gasped harry.
 QUIRTELL smiled.
his face wasn't twitching at all.
"me," he said calmly.
"i wondered whether i'd be meeting you here,  POTTER."
"but i thought --  SNAPE --"
    " SEVERUS_SNAPE?"
 QUIRTELL laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.
" YEWs,  SEVERUS_SNAPE does seem the type, doesn't he?
so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat.
next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering p-professor  QUIRTELL?"
harry couldn't take it in.
this couldn't be true, it couldn't.
"but  SNAPE tried to kill me!"
"no, no, no.
i tried to kill you.
your friend miss  GRANger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to  SNAPE at that quidditch match.
she broke my e YEW contact with you.
another few seconds and i'd have got you off that broom.
i'd have managed it before then if  SNAPE hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
" SNAPE was trying to save me?"
"of course," said  QUIRTELL coolly.
"\why do you think he wan TED to referee your next match?
he was trying to make sure i didn't do it again.
funny, really... he needn't have bothered.
i couldn't do anything with  DUmbledore watching.
all the other teachers thought  SNAPE was trying to stop  GRYFFINDOR from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, i'm going to kill you tonight."
 QUIRTELL snapped his fingers.
ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry.
"you're too nosy to live,  POTTER.
scurrying around the school on halloween like that, for all i knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone."
"you let the troll in?"
"certainly.
i have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there?
unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it,  SNAPE, who already suspec TED me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite  SNAPE's leg off properly.
"now, wait quietly,  POTTER.
i need to examine this interesting mirror.
it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind  QUIRTELL.
it was the mirror of erised.
"this mirror is the key to finding the stone,"  QUIRTELL murmured, tapping his way around the frame.
"trust  DUmbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in lon DON...
i'll be far away by the time he gets back...."
    all harry could think of doing was to keep  QUIRTELL talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.
"i saw you and  SNAPE in the forest --" he blur TED out.
" YEWs," said  QUIRTELL idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.
"he was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far i'd got.
he suspec TED me all along.
tried to frighten me - as though he could, when i had lord  VOLDEMORT on my side...."
     QUIRTELL came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.
"i see the stone...
i'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?"
harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give.
he had to keep  QUIRTELL from giving his whole attention to the mirror.
"but  SNAPE always seemed to hate me so much."
"oh, he does," said  QUIRTELL casually, "heavens,  YEWs.
he was at hogwarts with your father, didn't you know?
they loathed each other.
but he never wan TED you dead."
"but i heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- i thought  SNAPE was threatening you...."
    for the first time, a spasm of fear flit TED across  QUIRTELL's face.
"sometimes," he said, "i find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and i am weak --"
    "you mean he was there in the classroom with you?"
harry gasped.
"he is with me wherever i go," said  QUIRTELL quietly.
"i met him when i traveled around the world.
a foolish young man i was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil.
lord  VOLDEMORT showed me how wrong i was.
there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it....
since then, i have served him faithfully, although i have let him down many times.
he has had to be very hard on me."
 QUIRTELL shivered suddenly.
"he does not forgive mistakes easily.
when i failed to steal the stone from  GRINGOTTS, he was most displeased.
he punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...."
     QUIRTELL's voice trailed away.
harry was remembering his trip to  DIAGON_ALLEY -how could he have been so stupid?
he'd seen  QUIRTELL there that very day, shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron.
 QUIRTELL cursed under his breath.
"i  DON't understand... is the stone inside the mirror?
should i break it?"
harry's mind was racing.
what i want more than anything else in the world at the  MOMent, he thought, is to find the stone before  QUIRTELL does.
so if i look in the mirror, i should see myseff finding it -- which means i'll see where it's hidden!
but how can i look without  QUIRTELL realizing what i'm up to?
he tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without  QUIRTELL noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.
 QUIRTELL ignored him.
he was still talking to himself.
"what does this mirror do?
how does it work?
help me, master!"
and to harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from  QUIRTELL himself
    "use the boy... use the boy..."
     QUIRTELL rounded on harry.
" YEWs --  POTTER -- come here."
he clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding harry fell off.
harry got slowly to his feet.
"come here,"  QUIRTELL repea TED.
"look in the mirror and tell me what you see."
harry walked toward him.
i must lie, he thought desperately.
i must look and lie about what i see, that's all.
 QUIRTELL moved close behind him.
harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from  QUIRTELL's turban.
he closed his e YEWs, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
he saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.
but a  MOMent later, the reflection smiled at him.
it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone.
it winked and put the stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket.
somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the stone.
"well?"
said  QUIRTELL impatiently.
"what do you see?"
harry screwed up his courage.
"i see myself shaking hands with  DUmbledore," he inven TED.
"i -- i've won the house cup for  GRYFFINDOR."
 QUIRTELL cursed again.
"get out of the way," he said.
as harry moved aside, he felt the sorcerer's stone against his leg.
dare he make a break for it?
but he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though  QUIRTELL wasn't moving his lips.
"he lies...
he lies..."
    " POTTER, come back here!"
 QUIRTELL shou TED.
"tell me the truth!
what did you just see?"
the high voice spoke again.
"let me speak to him... face-to-face..."
    "master, you are not strong enough!"
"i have strength enough... for this...."
    harry felt as if  DEVIL's snare was rooting him to the spot.
he couldn't move a muscle.
petrified, he watched as  QUIRTELL reached up and began to unwrap his turban.
what was going on?
the turban fell away.
 QUIRTELL's head looked strangely small without it.
then he turned slowly on the spot.
harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound.
where there should have been a back to  QUIRTELL's head, there was a face, the most terrible face harry had ever seen.
it was chalk white with glaring red e YEWs and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
" HARRY_POTTER..." it whispered.
harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.
"see what i have become?"
the face said.
"mere shadow and vapor ...
i have form only when i can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful  QUIRTELL drinking it for me in the forest... and once i have the elixir of life, i will be able to create a body of my own.... now... why  DON't you give me that stone in your pocket?"
so he knew.
the feeling suddenly surged back into harry's legs.
he stumbled backward.
" DON't be a fool," snarled the face.
"better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents....
they died begging me for mercy..."
    "liar!"
harry shou TED suddenly.
 QUIRTELL was walking backward at him, so that  VOLDEMORT could still see him.
the evil face was now smiling.
"how touching..." it hissed.
"i always value bravery...
 YEWs, boy, your parents were brave....
i killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your  MOTHER needn't have died... she was trying to protect you.... now give me the stone, unless you want her to have died in vain."
"never!"
harry sprang toward the flame door, but  VOLDEMORT screamed "seize him!"
and the next second, harry felt  QUIRTELL's hand close on his wrist.
at once, a needle-sharp pain seared across harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he  YEWlled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise,  QUIRTELL let go of him.
the pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where  QUIRTELL had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his e YEWs.
"seize him!
seize him!"
shrieked  VOLDEMORT again, and  QUIRTELL lunged, knocking harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands around harry's neck -- harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain,  YEWt he could see  QUIRTELL howling in agony.
"master, i cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!"
and  QUIRTELL, though pinning harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
"then kill him, fool, and be  DONe!"
screeched  VOLDEMORT.
 QUIRTELL raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed  QUIRTELL's face --
    "aaaargh!"
 QUIRTELL rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then harry knew:  QUIRTELL couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of  QUIRTELL, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.
harry jumped to his feet, caught  QUIRTELL by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could.
 QUIRTELL screamed and tried to throw harry off -- the pain in harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only hear  QUIRTELL's terrible shrieks and  VOLDEMORT's  YEWlls of, "kill him!
kill him!"
and other voices, maybe in harry's own head, crying, "harry!
harry!"
he felt  QUIRTELL's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down...
    something gold was glinting just above him.
the snitch!
he tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.
he blinked.
it wasn't the snitch at all.
it was a pair of glasses.
how strange.
he blinked again.
the smiling face of  ALBUS_DUMBLEDORE swam into view above him.
"good afternoon, harry," said  DUmbledore.
harry stared at him.
then he remembered: "sir!
the stone!
it was  QUIRTELL!
he's got the stone!
sir, quick --"
    "calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said  DUmbledore.
" QUIRTELL does not have the stone."
"then who does?
sir, i --"
    "harry, please relax, or  MADAM_POMFTEY will have me thrown out.
harry swallowed and looked around him.
he realized he must be in the hospital wing.
he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
"tokens from your friends and admirers," said  DUmbledore, beaming.
"what happened down in the  DUngeons between you and professor  QUIRTELL is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.
i believe your friends misters  FRED_WEASLEY and  GEORGE_WEASLEY were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat.
no doubt they thought it would amuse you.
 MADAM_POMFTEY, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confisca TED it."
"how long have i been in here?"
"three days.
 MR._RONald weasley and miss  GRANger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried."
"but sit, the stone
    i see you are not to be distrac TED.
very well, the stone.
professor  QUIRTELL did not manage to take it from you.
i arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, i must say.
"you got there?
you got  HERMLONE's owl?"
"we must have crossed in midair.
no sooner had i reached lon DON than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left.
i arrived just in time to pull  QUIRTELL off you."
"it was you."
"i feared i might be too late."
"you nearly were, i couldn't have kept him off the stone much longer --"
    "not the stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you.
for one terrible  MOMent there, i was afraid it had.
as for the stone, it has been destro YEWd."
"destro YEWd?"
said harry blankly.
"but your friend --  MR._DUMBLEDORE flamel --"
    "oh, you know about  MR._DUMBLEDORE?"
said  DUmbledore, sounding quite deligh TED.
"you did do the thing properly, didn't you?
well,  MR._DUMBLEDORE and i have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
"but that means he and his wife will die, won't they?"
"they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,  YEWs, they will die."
 DUmbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry's face.
"to one as young as you, i'm sure it seems incredible, but to  MR._DUMBLEDORE and  PERENELLE, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day.
after all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
you know, the stone was really not such a wonderful thing.
as much money and life as you could want!
the two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them."
harry lay there, lost for words.
 DUmbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.
"sir?"
said harry.
"i've been thinking... sir -- even if the stone's gone, vol-, i mean,  YOU-KNOW- who --"
    "call him  VOLDEMORT, harry.
always use the proper name for things.
fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."
" YEWs, sir.
well,  VOLDEMORT's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he?
i mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"
"no, harry, he has not.
he is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.
he left  QUIRTELL to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.
nevertheless, harry, while you may only have dela YEWd his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is dela YEWd again, and again, why, he may never return to power."
harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt.
then he said, "sir, there are some other things i'd like to know, if you can tell me... things i want to know the truth about...."
    "the truth."
 DUmbledore sighed.
"it is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be trea TED with great caution.
however, i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to, in which case i beg you'll forgive me.
i shall not, of course, lie."
"well...  VOLDEMORT said that he only killed my  MOTHER because she tried to stop him from killing me.
but why would he want to kill me in the first place?"
 DUmbledore sighed very deeply this time.
"alas, the first thing you ask me, i cannot tell you.
not today.
not now.
you will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, harry.
when you are older...
i know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know."
and harry knew it would be no good to argue.
"but why couldn't  QUIRTELL touch me?"
"your  MOTHER died to save you.
if there is one thing  VOLDEMORT cannot understand, it is love.
he didn't realize that love as powerful as your  MOTHER's for you leaves its own mark.
not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever.
it is in your very skin.
 QUIRTELL, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with  VOLDEMORT, could not touch you for this reason.
it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good."
 DUmbledore now became very interes TED in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave harry time to dry his e YEWs on the sheet.
when he had found his voice again, harry said, "and the invisibility cl OAK - do you know who sent it to me?"
"ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and i thought you might like it."
 DUmbledore's e YEWs twinkled.
"useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here."
"and there's something else..."
    "fire away."
" QUIRTELL said  SNAPE --"
    "professor  SNAPE, harry."
" YEWs, him --  QUIRTELL said he hates me because he ha TED my father.
is that true?"
"well, they did rather detest each other.
not unlike yourself and mr.  MALFOY.
and then, your father did something  SNAPE could never forgive."
"what?"
"he saved his life."
"what?"
" YEWs..." said  DUmbledore dreamily.
"funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it?
professor  SNAPE couldn't bear being in your father's debt....
i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this  YEWar because he felt that would make him and your father even.
then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace...."
    harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.
"and sir, there's one more thing..."
    "just the one?"
"how did i get the stone out of the mirror?"
"ah, now, i'm glad you asked me that.
it was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something.
you see, only one who wan TED to find the stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life.
my brain surprises even me sometimes.... now, enough questions.
i suggest you make a start on these sweets.
ah!
 BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans!
i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then i'm afraid i've rather lost my liking for them -- but i think i'll be safe with a nice toffee,  DON't you?"
he smiled and popped the golden- BROWN bean into his mouth.
then he choked and said, "alas!
ear wax!"
 MADAM_POMFTEY, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
"just five minutes," harry pleaded.
"absolutely not."
"you let professor  DUmbledore in..."
    "well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different.
you need rest."
"i am resting, look, lying down and everything.
oh, go on,  MADAM_POMFTEY..."
    "oh, very well," she said.
"but five minutes only."
and she let ron and  HERMLONE in.
"harry!"
 HERMLONE looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
"oh, harry, we were sure you were going to --  DUmbledore was so worried --"
    "the whole school's talking about it," said ron.
"what really happened?"
it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors.
harry told them everything:  QUIRTELL; the mirror; the stone; and  VOLDEMORT.
ron and  HERMLONE were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when harry told them what was under  QUIRTELL's turban,  HERMLONE screamed out loud.
"so the stone's gone?"
said ron finally.
"flamel's just going to die?"
"that's what i said, but  DUmbledore thinks that -- what was it?
-- 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
"i always said he was off his rocker," said ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.
"so what happened to you two?"
said harry.
"well, i got back all right," said  HERMLONE.
"i brought ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact  DUmbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, 'harry's gone after him, hasn't he?'
and hurtled off to the third floor."
"d'you think he meant you to do it?"
said ron.
"sending you your father's cl OAK and everything?"
"well, "  HERMLONE exploded, "if he did -- i mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed."
"no, it isn't," said harry thoughtfully.
"he's a funny man,  DUmbledore.
i think he sort of wan TED to give me a chance.
i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know.
i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help.
i  DON't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked.
it's almost like he thought i had the right to face  VOLDEMORT if i could...."
    " YEWah,  DUmbledore's off his rocker, all right," said ron proudly.
"listen, you've got to be up for the end-of- YEWar feast  TOMorrow.
the points are all in and  SLYTHERINS won, of course -- you missed the last quidditch match, we were steamrollered by  RAVENCLAW without you -- but the food'll be good."
at that  MOMent,  MADAM_POMFTEY bustled over.
"you've had nearly fifteen minutes, now out" she said firmly.
after a good night's s LEE_JORDANp, harry felt nearly back to normal.
i want to go to the feast," he told  MADAM_POMFTEY as she straightened his many candy boxes.
i can, can't i?"
"professor  DUmbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said stiffily, as though in her opinion professor  DUmbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be.
"and you have another visitor."
"oh, good," said harry.
"who is it?"
hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke.
as usual when he was indoors, hagrid looked too big to be allowed.
he sat down next to harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.
"it's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!"
he sobbed, his face in his hands.
i told the evil git how ter get past  FLUFFY!
i told him!
it was the only thing he didn't know, an' i told him!
 YEWh could've died!
all for a dragon egg!
i'll never drink again!
i should be chucked out an' made ter live as a muggle!"
"hagrid!"
said harry, shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard.
"hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is  VOLDEMORT we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him."
" YEWh could've died!"
sobbed hagrid.
"an'  DON' say the name!"
" VOLDEMORT!"
harry  CHASER_KATIE_BELLowed, and hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying.
"i've met him and i'm calling him by his name.
please cheer up, hagrid, we saved the stone, it's gone, he can't use it.
have a chocolate frog, i've got loads...."
    hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, "that reminds me.
i've got  YEWh a present."
"it's not a stoat sandwich, is it?"
said harry anxiously, and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
"nah.
 DUmbledore gave me the day off  YEWsterday ter fix it.
'course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got  YEWh this..."
    it seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.
harry opened it curiously.
it was full of wizard photographs.
smiling and waving at him from every page were his  MOTHER and father.
"sent owls off ter all  YEWr parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew  YEWh didn' have any... d' YEWh like it?"
harry couldn't speak, but hagrid understood.
harry made his way down to the end-of- YEWar feast alone that night.
he had been held up by  MADAM_POMFTEY's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the great hall was already full.
it was decked out in the  SLYTHERINS colors of green and silver to celebrate  SLYTHERINS's winning the house cup for the seventh  YEWar in a row.
a huge banner showing the  SLYTHERINS serpent covered the wall behind the high table.
when harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody star TED talking loudly at once.
he slipped into a seat between ron and  HERMLONE at the  GRYFFINDOR table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.
fortunately,  DUmbledore arrived  MOMents later.
the babble died away.
"another  YEWar gone!"
 DUmbledore said cheerfully.
"and i must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.
what a  YEWar it has been!
hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next  YEWar starts....
    "now, as i understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: in fourth place,  GRYFFINDOR, with three hundred and twelve points; in third,  HUFFLEPUFFS, with three hundred and fifty-two;  RAVENCLAW has four hundred and twenty-six and  SLYTHERINS, four hundred and seventy- two."
a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the  SLYTHERINS table.
harry could see draco  MALFOY banging his goblet on the table.
it was a sickening sight.
" YEWs,  YEWs, well  DONe,  SLYTHERINS," said  DUmbledore.
"however, recent events must be taken into account."
the room went very still.
the  SLYTHERINS' smiles faded a little.
"ahem," said  DUmbledore.
"i have a few last-minute points to dish out.
let me see.
 YEWs...
    "first -- to  MR._RONald weasley..."
    ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
"...for the best-pla YEWd game of chess hogwarts has seen in many  YEWars, i award  GRYFFINDOR house fifty points."
 GRYFFINDOR cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.
 PERCY_WEASLEY could be heard telling the other prefects, "my brother, you know!
my youngest brother!
got past  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's giant chess set!"
at last there was silence again.
"second -- to miss  HERMIONE_GRANGER... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, i award  GRYFFINDOR house fifty points."
 HERMLONE buried her face in her arms; harry strongly suspec TED she had burst into tears.
 GRYFFINDORs up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up.
"third -- to mr.  HARRY_POTTER..." said  DUmbledore.
the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, i award  GRYFFINDOR house sixty points."
the din was deafening.
those who could add up while  YEWlling themselves hoarse knew that  GRYFFINDOR now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as  SLYTHERINS.
they had tied for the house cup -- if only  DUmbledore had  GIVEN_HARRY just one more point.
 DUmbledore raised his hand.
the room gra DUally fell silent.
"there are all kinds of courage," said  DUmbledore, smiling.
"it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
i therefore award ten points to mr.  MR._LONGBOTTOM longbot TOM."
someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erup TED from the  GRYFFINDOR table.
harry, ron, and  HERMLONE stood up to  YEWll and cheer as  MR._LONGBOTTOM, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.
he had never won so much as a point for  GRYFFINDOR before.
harry, still cheering, nudged ron in the ribs and poin TED at  MALFOY, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the body-bind curse put on him.
"which means,  DUmbledore called over the storm of applause, for even  RAVENCLAW and  HUFFLEPUFFS were celebrating the downfall of  SLYTHERINS, "we need a little change of decoration."
he clapped his hands.
in an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge  SLYTHERINS serpent vanished and a towering  GRYFFINDOR lion took its place.
 SNAPE was shaking professor  MINERVA_MCGONAGALL's hand, with a horrible, forced smile.
he caught harry's e YEW and harry knew at once that  SNAPE's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot.
this didn't worry harry.
it seemed as though life would be back to normal next  YEWar, or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts.
it was the best evening of harry's life, better than winning at quidditch, or christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.
harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did.
to their great surprise, both he and ron passed with good marks;  HERMLONE, of course, had the best grades of the first  YEWars.
even  MR._LONGBOTTOM scraped through, his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one.
they had hoped that  GOYLE, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too.
it was a shame, but as ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.
and suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,  MR._LONGBOTTOM's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays ("i always hope they'll forget to give us these," said  FRED_WEASLEY sadly); hagrid was there to take them down to the f LEE_JORDANt of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the hogwarts express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating  BETTIE_BOTT's every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at king's cross station.
it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform.
a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles.
"you must come and stay this summer," said ron, "both of you -- i'll send you an owl."
"thanks," said harry, "i'll need something to look forward to."
people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world.
some of them called:
    "b YEW, harry!"
"see you,  POTTER!"
"still famous," said ron, grinning at him.
"not where i'm going, i promise you," said harry.
he, ron, and  HERMLONE passed through the gateway together.
"there he is,  MOM, there he is, look!"
it was  GINNY_WEASLEY, ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at ron.
" HARRY_POTTER!"
she squealed.
"look,  MOM!
i can see
    "be quiet,  GINNY_WEASLEY, and it's rude to point."
 MRS._WEASLEY smiled down at them.
"busy  YEWar?"
she said.
"very," said harry.
"thanks for the fudge and the sweater, mrs.
weasley."
"oh, it was nothing, dear."
"ready, are you?"
it was  UNCLE_VERNON, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.
behind him stood  AUNT_PETUNIA and  DUdley, looking terrified at the very sight of harry.
"you must be harry's family!"
said  MRS._WEASLEY.
"in a manner of speaking," said  UNCLE_VERNON.
"hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day."
he walked away.
harry hung back for a last word with ron and  HERMLONE.
"see you over the summer, then."
"hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said  HERMLONE, looking uncertainly after  UNCLE_VERNON, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.
"oh, i will," said harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face.
"they  DON't know we're not allowed to use magic at home.
i'm going to have a lot of fun with  DUdley this summer...."
    the end
